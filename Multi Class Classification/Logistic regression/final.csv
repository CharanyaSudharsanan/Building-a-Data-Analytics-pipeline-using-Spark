during that transition and then started the Gannon Center for Women and Leadership at Loyola The feeling always was We rather be dead than coed There no evidence that the hi  has cut into the sisters support for Loyola basketball By all accounts though the Chicago Cubs march to World Series championship two years ago drew much larger audience in the community room Sister Kate Keating is the resident Cubs expert who at the World Series parade told reporter that she knew she was Cubs fan before she knew she was Catholic Still before the tournament Sister Bernadette had to tell her what

Macs to win it all Instead her Final Four teams are Loyola Villanova Gonzaga and one non Catholic team Clemson After that so much for her loyalty to Sister Jean She chose Villanova to win the

Mobile and Sprint man who wanted to come off as the consummate outsider will have pulled off the ultimate insider move CreditMichael Nagle BloombergBy David GellesMay At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas Mobile chief executive John Legere crashed the AT party at the Venetian hotel Wearing black leather jacket and his customary pink Mobile shirt Mr Legere said he was just hoping to see the rapper Macklemore perform It didn work Mr Legere was soon noticed and escorted out by security and he told the tech site Recode threatened with charges if he didn leave the premises But before he left Mr Legere managed to pause long enough to speak with reporter and trash AT Since taking over Mobile in Mr Legere has made name for himself with those kinds of publicity stunts promoting his own brand while undermining the competition But now Mr Legere may have truly crashed the party On Sunday Mobile agreed to acquire its longtime rival Sprint for billion If the deal is completed Mobile will be about the same size as AT Only Verizon   be bigger Under the terms of the proposed deal Mr Legere   become chief executive of the combined company which   keep the Mobile name It bold move and one that illustrates Mr Legere willingness to disrupt the status quo even if he   to have the weaker hand He wants to take on the titans of AT and Verizon said Steve Grasso director of institutional sales at Stuart Frankel and market analyst for CNBC who knows Mr Legere socially He pit bull The combination of Mobile and Sprint has been years in the making as both companies have sought to add scale and compete with their larger rivals Yet the last time the companies formally attempted deal in it was Sprint that was planning to acquire Mobile That deal fell apart in the face of regulatory scrutiny And since then Mr Legere has managed to build Mobile business by flouting convention Under his leadership Mobile began offering unlimited data reduced prices and less stringent contract commitments ImageMr Legere left has for years favored Mobile pink in his wardrobe The Sprint chief executive Marcelo Claure added Sprint yellow to his outfit after their two companies announced an agreement to combine CreditBrendan Mcdermid ReutersWhen Mr Legere took over in he was very different executive and Mobile was very different company Mobile was reeling from failed attempt to sell itself to AT and struggling to distinguish itself from other low cost carriers like Sprint and Metro PCS Mr Legere who spent years working at AT was conventional if ambitious telecommunications executive He was finance guy said Dan Hesse the former chief executive of Sprint who was mentor of Mr Legere at AT The first time saw John after he was named of Mobile he was there in his suit That soon changed In Mr Legere was onstage at an event in Las Vegas with Joe Torre the former manager of the Yankees promoting partnership between Mobile and Major League Baseball When reporters asked him about the state of the wireless industry he responded with tirade about how badly customers were mistreated and what he planned to do differently It hit chord he told Business Insider It was an action statement for me sure it sounded bit arrogant that was going to fix this industry From then on started to be the brand Soon Mr Legere now had whole new look He grew his hair to his shoulders He wore company shirts wherever he went He pulled on custom pink Converse sneakers emblazoned with the Mobile logo Before long the finance guy looked more like an aging rock star At the same time Mr Legere embraced social media as tool to promote himself and needle his adversaries On Facebook he started cooking show Slow Cooker Sunday On YouTube he called AT and Verizon dumb and dumber And on Twitter he began hurling insults at competitors and tangling with rival including Sprint Marcelo Claure Twitter users ate it up and Mr Legere now has more than million followers Twitter even designed him custom emoji Offline Mr Legere also cultivated an eccentric image He is regular visitor to Mobile stores and call centers where he delivers boisterous pep talks At company meetings he offers employees if they will ask him question in the form of song And in the office he is fond of riding around on Segway ImageMr Legere taking selfie before Mobile event in Los Angeles in He has cultivated an eccentric image with boisterous pep talks to employees and the look of an aging rock star CreditPatrick Fallon Bloomberg John has built franchise around Mobile which is in part his own said Stephen Scherr head of the consumer and commercial banking division at Goldman Sachs who has worked with Mr Legere for more than decade But Mr Legere has paired showmanship with results During his tenure Mobile has added subscribers and increased revenues and profits He also great operator Mr Scherr said He runs really good business If Mr Legere succeeds in finally joining Mobile and Sprint the man who wanted to come off as the consummate outsider will have pulled off the ultimate insider move mega merger to combine two rival companies and seize greater share of changing industry Regulators are certain to take close look at the proposed combination and there is chance they   block the deal However there is reason to believe that they   view the union more favorably than they did four years ago Under President Trump antitrust enforcement has become unpredictable The Justice Department has mounted court fight against the proposed combination of AT and Time Warner which do not directly compete with each other At the same time there   to be little resistance to the proposed acquisition of st Century Fox assets by Disney deal which   reduce competition in the film and television industry Mr Legere who is sensitive to public perceptions seems to have anticipated this moment In January after Mr Trump election but before his inauguration Mr Legere was asked about his view of the regulatory environment under the Trump administration It hard not to be excited he said about regulatory views that   be conducive to us significantly expanding our business Mr Legere added that he was hoping to meet Mr Trump and offered roundabout praise for the president famously antagonistic approach to social media saying that Mr Trump had replaced him as one of the kings of mean on Twitter Mr Legere knew from firsthand experience In after Mr Trump insulted the fighter Ronda Rousey on Twitter Mr Legere came to her defense In the ensuing exchange Mr Legere said Mr Trump wasn presidential material am an undecided Republican Mr Legere wrote Well not totally undecided know what don want But it seems that the prospect of multibillion dollar deal can heal old wounds Mr Legere has since deleted that tweet

basketball team But that didn stop the Mets ace Noah Syndergaard from jokingly testing out both nicknames when talking about the team much ballyhooed but oft injured group of starters Because Jason Vargas is slated to have surgery on his hand Tuesday Zack Wheeler is widely expected to take his spot in the rotation The Mets then will begin the season finally deploying the core rotation of the five hard throwers they once dreamed   lead them to the promised land Jacob deGrom Matt Harvey Steven Matz Syndergaard and Wheeler We need cool nickname said Syndergaard Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson   not predict how long the team   be without Vargas who is expected to be part of the rotation once he recovers After the broken hamate bone is removed from Vargas non throwing hand he must wait until the wound has healed the pain has subsided and his grip strength has returned before he can resume throwing The Mets estimated that   be about five days after Vargas operation The season begins March and the soonest the Mets need fifth starter is April If the Mets are cautious Vargas may miss only one or two starts The most he has thrown in spring training game is pitches while his fellow starters have reached When you re talking about five days you re not going to lose arm strength e ly with guy like Vargas who is going to rely on command Mets Manager Mickey Callaway said Though the operation is slight setback for Vargas it also   provide fleeting but symbolic moment for the Mets Something that ve been thinking about and wanting to do for while Wheeler who was fighting to make the opening day roster said of the five starters all pitching at once Fans have too The Mets did not initially plan to build around their five talented starters all of whom have fastballs in excess of miles per hour While Harvey in and Matz in were drafted in the first and second rounds the Mets traded for Wheeler in and for Syndergaard year later Catcher Travis Arnaud not Syndergaard was the centerpiece of trade with Toronto DeGrom ninth round pick blossomed into top prospect for the Mets after converting from shortstop to pitcher But once Syndergaard and Matz reached the major leagues in the Mets dreamed big Harvey was having dominant season DeGrom had been named the National League Rookie of the Year the season before The only one missing was Wheeler who had debuted in and

crown We re here to do this more often Injuries scuttled that plan Harvey free agent after this season hasn been the same since that World Series Wheeler was supposed to return for the second half of the season but endured several setbacks The Mets reached the wild card game despite DeGrom Matz and Harvey having had surgery that year The closest the Mets ever got to having all five starters in the same rotation was last season but Matz now landed on the disabled list with an elbow injury week before the season began Syndergaard Wheeler and Harvey joined him there later in the season DeGrom was the only Mets starter to play through the entire disappointing season And now some of them aren so young by baseball standards Harvey will be soon and deGrom will turn in June Vargas was signed last

  byBig CityThe Actress the Governor and Performance PoliticsImageCynthia Nixon found fame on show that celebrated luxury in the city Now she has made the gulf between New York rich and poor core message of her campaign for public office CreditSam Hodgson for The  By Ginia BellafanteMarch On frigid Tuesday morning in Brooklyn Cynthia Nixon in her first official campaign venture made the case for herself to become the next governor of New York an impassioned liberal who   lead vigorously from the left Her choice of venue the Bethesda Healing Center church in Brownsville historically the poorest neighborhood in New York City suggested she meant it Reflecting the surrounding demographics the audience was made up almost entirely of African Americans population she argued the current governor Andrew Cuomo has disregarded with too little investment in public schools too little effort made at eradicating inequality too much capitulation to big moneyed interests and venal and corrupt state legislators Ms Nixon laid out her biography the child of single mother with whom she had lived in fifth floor walk up graduate of New York City public schools who sends her own children to them young woman who paid for her college education herself The unspoken assertion was both obvious and deft that while she may be an actress she is in fact the real thing it is her opponent with his back room dealing and corporate coddling and dynastic affiliations who stands as the role player and the phony Many have found Mr Cuomo sincerity as progressive Democrat dubious if not entirely unconvincing but the problem for Ms Nixon is that as performer of related ideologies in recent years he has done quite well Ever since Zephyr Teachout an unknown law professor challenged him for his second term run in to surprising results in the primary he has been forced to tack left signing legislation two years ago to enact an hour minimum wage as well as paid family leave More recently he proposed sweeping package of criminal justice reforms that   among other actions eliminate monetary bail and reduce delays and adjournments in court proceedings that keep people unnecessarily in jail As feminist too his stagecraft has been successful On Monday as Ms Nixon said that she   run Mr Cuomo directed the state attorney general to review the ways in which the Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance Jr had handled or mishandled allegation of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein In her speech on Tuesday Ms Nixon called for greater investment in the city ever deteriorating public housing system Only few days earlier during an appearance at the Jackson  s in the Bronx the governor who served as the federal housing secretary under President Bill Clinton said he was prepared to declare state of emergency in the buildings of the New York City Housing Authority which   allow him to replace its failing management team appointed by the city He also promised to release million of state funds to the agency once an independent monitor had been appointed to oversee all that has gone wrong In the continuing war between the governor and Mayor Bill de Blasio it has been Mr Cuomo who has been continually advancing amounting to another hindrance for Ms Nixon longtime public education activist she has been strong supporter of the mayor but Mr de Blasio who is so intensely disliked by so many of his own Democratic constituents   provide her with little advantage in her own race Within two hours of Ms Nixon speech on Tuesday the former City Council speaker Christine Quinn openly gay and an ally of the governor declared via The New York Post that Ms Nixon was an unqualified lesbian who should not have opposed her own more viable bid to become the mayor of New York several years ago when Mr de Blasio won his first term Ms Quinn lost in part because she was unable to come up with pitch that voters found as resonant as Mr de Blasio tale of two cities rhetoric his focus on the vast gaps between the rich and the disadvantaged Ms Nixon wants to stand in the same philosophical space railing against the unaffordable city the tyranny of urban plutocrats But she earned her celebrity and fortune through pop cultural product Sex and the City that promoted vision of New York that stands entirely in opposition to her professed values It was the HBO series beyond any other entertainment that helped solidify the image of the city as luxury brand an elite fantastical consumer paradise where it was never too early or late in the day to buy an pair of shoes Is Cynthia Nixon

  byBolton Was Early Beneficiary of Cambridge Analytica Facebook DataImageThe John Bolton Super PAC first hired Cambridge Analytica in August while it was still harvesting Facebook data CreditBrendan Smialowski Agence France Presse Getty ImagesBy Matthew RosenbergMarch WASHINGTON The political action committee founded by John Bolton President Trump incoming national security adviser was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica which it hired specifically to develop psychological profiles of voters with data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook profiles according to former Cambridge employees and company documents Mr Bolton political committee known as The John Bolton Super PAC first hired Cambridge in August months after the political data firm was founded and while it was still harvesting the Facebook data In the two years that followed Mr Bolton super PAC spent nearly million primarily for survey research which is term that campaigns use for polling according to campaign finance records But the contract between the political action committee and Cambridge copy of which was obtained by The   offers more detail on just what Mr Bolton was buying The contract broadly describes the services to be delivered by Cambridge as behavioral microtargeting with psychographic messaging To do that work Cambridge used Facebook data according to the documents and two former employees familiar with the work The data and modeling Bolton PAC received was derived from the Facebook data said Christopher Wylie data expert who was part of the team that founded Cambridge Analytica We definitely told them about how we were doing it We talked about it in conference calls in meetings Cambridge Analytica which rose to prominence through its work with Mr Trump election campaign has found itself confronting deepening crisis since reports this past weekend in The   and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters Cambridge so called psychographic modeling techniques which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook underpinned its work for Mr Trump campaign in setting off furious and still unsettled debate about whether the firm technology worked The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr Bolton super PAC The Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was becoming limp wristed and spineless and it wanted research and messaging for national security issues Mr Wylie said That really meant making people more militaristic in their worldview he added That what they said they wanted anyway Using the psychographic models Cambridge helped design concepts for advertisements for candidates supported by Mr Bolton PAC including the campaign of Thom Tillis the Republican senator from North Carolina according to Mr Wylie and another former employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being dragged into the investigations that now appear to be engulfing Cambridge One advertisement video that was posted on YouTube was aimed at people who scored high for conscientiousness and were thought to respect hard work and experience It emphasized Mr Bolton time working for Ronald Reagan and how Mr Tillis embodied the spirit and political ethos of the late president Beyond their conservative politics Mr Trump Mr Bolton and Cambridge Analytica all share patron the Mercer family of Long Island whose patriarch Robert Mercer made fortune at the helm of top yielding hedge fund Cambridge Analytica which grew out of the London based SCL Group was founded in with million investment from Mr Mercer whose daughter Rebekah sits on the firm board of directors Stephen Bannon was also co founder At the same time Mr Mercer was financially supporting Mr Bolton PAC donating million between April and September according to Federal Election Commission filings The Mercers also backed Mr Trump in the presidential election The Mercer family has not publicly commented since the reports about the misuse of Facebook data by Cambridge first surfaced in The   and The Observer The reports have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica The company also suspended its chief executive Alexander Nix after television broadcast this week in which he was recorded suggesting that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections But it is the harvesting of Facebook data that has cast the harshest spotlight on Cambridge and Mr Bolton experience with the company   to have provided model for how it sold itself to future political campaigns including Mr Trump The firm took the psychographic profiles it was building off the Facebook data at the time and combined them with voter databases and other sets of data Staff from SCL elections division which through convoluted corporate structure was interchangeable with Cambridge discussed what they were doing at meeting in July with another contractor for the Bolton PAC according to an agenda of the meeting obtained by The   The profiles   be used to identify the personality traits of individuals in states to be targeted by the Bolton PAC said the agenda which was prepared for SCL and Cambridge staff Individuals can be targeted with the right message it said The agenda also included line in boldfaced text that said SCL wanted to use voter contact lists available to Bolton campaign to direct people toward the FB app Cambridge working through an outside researcher used Facebook app to harvest data from the social network profiles The app claimed to be collecting data for academic research and users were not aware of its true purpose Months later the relationship between Cambridge and the Bolton PAC had grown so close that the firm was writing up talking points for Mr Bolton In an email dated Oct Cambridge staff outlined few sentences that Mr Bolton   use to describe the work the new firm was doing for his super PAC It not just about how much you spend It also about how smart you spend the email advised Mr Bolton to say One way we re doing that is by enlisting an outside firm Cambridge Analytica to provide deepdive research into who makes up our audience of target voters it  d We are producing ads specifically designed for voters of certain personality and demographic profile So if you re young woman in New Hampshire with specific kind of personality and particular set of issues that you care about our research allows us to connect with

CreditKathy Willens Associated Press Justin Aller Getty ImagesBy Zach SchonbrunMarch WILMINGTON Del Delaware is known for its association with recent vice president of the United States the du Pont family and friendly bankruptcy laws For its basketball pedigree Not so much Donte DiVincenzo always wanted to become professional athlete But as with many Delawareans his favorite sport was soccer When he started to concentrate on basketball shortly before high school the decision was unpopular There have been only athletes inducted into the state sports hall of fame for basketball Three were referees But Delaware basketball chops have never been stronger now that two products of the First State are competing in the round of of the men basketball tournament DiVincenzo the sixth man for Villanova and Trevon Duval the starting point guard for Duke third Peyton Heck is Villanova walk on If you re from Delaware you re part of very big family said Elena Delle Donne the star and perhaps the most accomplished basketball player the state has produced Rooting for these guys on the national stage is moment that everyone in Delaware will be tuning in to ImageThe state flag of Delaware the First State hangs at the Boys Girls Club where Duke Trevon Duval played in Wilmington Del CreditMark Makela for The  In other words it rare When was the last time pair of Delawareans were playing key roles this late in March It been while Stan Waterman the coach at Sanford School in Hockessin said can really remember In fact there have been more players to hail from Montana than from Delaware seven And while yes Montana outdoes Delaware in size and population consider that the District of Columbia has   the pedigree with only two thirds the population There are some reasons for this Delaware was one of two states last year in which more high school boys played lacrosse than basketball the other was Maryland There were more athletes playing soccer and football in the state as well Richard Lapchick chairman of the sports business management program at Central Florida and director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport said lack of opportunity and top flight competition in the state was mostly to blame Delaware has only high schools competing in one division in high school basketball Doug Gelbert author of The Great er Delaware Sports Book which at pages is light read said the state best players such as the former Temple and guard Terence Stansbury frequently traveled to Philadelphia from Newark Del for pickup games ImageTrevon Duval had Delaware area code and New Castle the name of his hometown tattooed on his leg CreditMarc Tracy The   It not just hoops Gelbert wrote in an email Delaware has not had national reputation in any sport since the days of rifle shooting about years ago Maybe billiards in the This has left Delaware with bit of Napoleon complex when it comes to basketball It isn new Spencer Dunkley University of Delaware center once guaranteed to walk back to Delaware if his th seeded team lost to fourth seeded Louisville in the tournament Naturally it lost That was in Delaware remains winless in the tournament And the state is eager to shed its reputation as the drive through interlude on Interstate between two basketball hotbeds Philadelphia and Baltimore Those states kind of ate us up Mark Sills longtime organizer of youth basketball said of Pennsylvania and Maryland We ve had great players come out of here but we don get the publicity Even the publicity that players do get can have sarcastic undertone Villanova Coach Jay Wright for instance has called DiVincenzo the Michael Jordan of Delaware The nickname has stuck He certainly put Delaware on map DiVincenzo high school coach Brendan Haley said ImageBasketball trophies are displayed at the Boys Girls Club where Duval learned the game before going to Duke Stars like Duval often leave the state in search of better competition and opportunities CreditMark Makela for The  ImageSalesianum School won back to back state basketball championships when DiVincenzo starred there CreditMark Makela for The  Duval has put Delaware on his leg The area code is tattooed on his left calf along with the name of his hometown New Castle Though he went outside the state for high school he maintains connection Last year he returned to Sanford School which serves grades through and where he went to middle school to attend prom lot of people are excited Scott Klatzkin the voice of University of Delaware athletics said There lot of in state pride when somebody from little old Delaware makes it Folks in Delaware still talk wistfully about Walter Davis an adopted son he was born in North Carolina and played at Sanford for year in and English who was born in Wilmington and played two years in the for the Washington Bullets The closest comparison for player like Duval however might be Delle Donne the Wilmington native and transcendent superstar for the University of Delaware who was drafted second over all by the Chicago Sky in Sills said he had detected clear uptick in interest among girls players thanks to her influence The hope Waterman said is that Duval will have similar impact for boys basketball in the state Whether he wants to he carrying the flag right now said Waterman five time state champion Everybody watching him All the youth league coaches are talking about him and putting his face out there for all the youngsters Unlike Duval DiVincenzo stayed around for high school winning two state titles for Salesianum School in Wilmington Before he showed up the program had won more than state titles in sports like swimming cross country and lacrosse but never in basketball ImageMark Sills president of Wilmington youth basketball league said Delaware had produced fine players but was often overshadowed by Pennsylvania and Maryland CreditMark Makela for The  ImageThe Rev Chris Beretta of Salesianum School was an assistant basketball coach when Villanova DiVincenzo played there CreditMark Makela for The  At Salesianum on Tuesday some students were wearing Villanova hats which is understandable considering the campus is miles away Faculty members were eager to reminisce about DiVincenzo dazzling days as Sallie He had some natural athleticism that was just so rare the Rev Chris Beretta the school principal and assistant basketball coach said You just never knew He   all of sudden just turn it on But after DiVincenzo junior year rumor began to circulate that he was planning to leave to attend prep school out of state It grew pervasive enough that Villanova coaches called Haley at Salesianum to assure him that they were not the ones encouraging him to leave If you re in Delaware that almost the thing to do Haley said People start talking about where you re going to go Clearly it touched nerve This is problem for Delaware Its best players are too often emigrating out because the competition outside the state is superior Better opportunities bigger stage Duval said about his own decision to leave phrase Delawareans have heard often Eric Ayala top prospect who is committed to play at Maryland left Sanford after his sophomore year to attend prep school in Connecticut and then IMG Academy in Bradenton Fla Some  you re that big fish in small pond Waterman said And they just want to try different things DiVincenzo stayed won another state title and has been considered basketball royalty in the state ever since Every time go home now everyone knows who am he said They welcome me anywhere It   be easy for the adulation to go to his head But even the Michael Jordan of Delaware still plays with chip on his shoulder don want to say he better than Walter Davis Haley said but he given Delaware

  byIndiana Candidate Rhetoric Business Record Don Line UpBy The Associated PressMay INDIANAPOLIS Oklahoma truck driver Timothy Jackson was recovering from emergency heart surgery when he learned he lost his job and his health insurance along with it because managers at the company Indiana headquarters decided he wasn healthy enough to work The multimillionaire who owns that business and several others former Indiana state Rep Mike Braun is locked in bitter Republican primary with two congressmen for the right to challenge Democrat Joe Donnelly in one of the nation most closely watched Senate races Braun has blamed career politicians for outsourcing good paying jobs overseas while pledging he ll help bring them back Yet when it comes to his own business empire which includes handful of interrelated companies Braun record falls far short of his campaign rhetoric review by The Associated Press found Meyer Distributing Jasper based national auto parts distribution company Braun owns does brisk business importing goods from the same overseas countries he has criticized for taking American jobs He also has accepted government subsidies despite criticizing the practice And lawsuits filed against his companies backed up by federal trucking and labor records present picture of boss who has overworked and underpaid employees That   blunt charges of hypocrisy Braun has leveled against Donnelly longtime outsourcing critic who sold stock in family business after the AP reported the company owned factory in Mexico It also opens him up to similar charges from his GOP opponents in the May primary Luke Messer and Todd Rokita whom he has accused of saying one thing on the campaign trail only to do something else when you get to Campaign spokesman Josh Kelley said Braun tries to distribute American made goods but faces profitability challenges in global economy He also denied that workers are treated poorly However over the past decade workers have sued in West Virginia Oklahoma and California alleging they were forced to work long hours in unsafe conditions and denied overtime pay meal   and breaks In March Jackson the Oklahoma truck driver was recovering at home from emergency surgery to fix heart defect when his local manager hand delivered letter informing him that he had been fired Jackson boss told him it was not up to him detail confirmed in company court filing that acknowledged Jackson was fired because managers doubted he   do his job Braun often touts his companies heath care coverage which he re engineered to reduce costs by requiring that employees pay more upfront He says it provides better coverage while being less paternalistic Another Oklahoma employee alleged in that withheld overtime was paid only after he filed formal complaint The employee said he was fired days later in retaliation according to court records He settled out of court In West Virginia driver alleged he was forced to falsify log books to conceal time spent on the road that exceeded federal regulations that limit driving time to hours per day The employee says he was fired after he refused to keep up schedule that demanded to hour days according to court records That lawsuit also was settled out of court Federal Department of Transportation records show Braun operation has been cited   since September for unsafe driving violations and   for truck driver hours of service violations Additionally Meyer was cited   for wage and overtime pay violations between and according to the Department of Labor His campaign says Meyer safety rating is better than the industry average Braun whose net worth is somewhere between million and million has often compared himself to President Donald Trump because both grew wealthy in the private sector before entering politics Candidates who live in glass  s shouldn throw stones said Julia Vaughn policy director of the liberal leaning good government group Common Cause Indiana always concerned when candidates talk about wanting to run government like business because people who are extremely successful in business some  get there by cutting corners and treating employees unfairly While Braun has used his wealth to run blitz of ads criticizing politicians for putting Mexico before Muncie and Beijing before Bloomington he hasn always been critic of free trade and outsourcing As state legislator he voted in against bipartisan clawback legislation that   have allowed Indiana governments to recoup financial incentives given to companies that move jobs abroad The legislation was proposed in the wake of Carrier Corp announcing that it was moving hundreds of manufacturing jobs from Indianapolis to Mexico Dozens of foreign or foreign owned auto parts companies do business with Braun according to Meyer Distributing website The company has received repeated shipments of foreign made goods over the past five years most of which are from China according to records maintained by the trade tracking website Import Genius During February debate however he denied knowing where the parts he sells come from deal with American manufacturers We buy their products don know where they get them made Braun said Recently Braun criticized online shopping giant Amazon which has named Indianapolis as potential site for second corporate headquarters At campaign event Braun said he is not in favor of granting incentives in such situations suggesting companies shouldn be subsidized by the government Braun however pursued similar job creation incentives over the last six years which are set to pay out at least million records show Kelley the campaign spokesman said Braun   stand up for workers should he be elected Mike will be voice for the little guy and will show the same commitment to Hoosiers that he demonstrated to employees at Meyer over the last years Kelley said Advertisement,2

everybody gives Don say you re for Pelosi former Democratic representative said CreditErin Schaff for The  By Jonathan Martin and Alexander BurnsMarch WASHINGTON few hours after Conor Lamb the Pennsylvania Democrat claimed victory in   race with vow to oppose his party leader Nancy Pelosi the once and perhaps future speaker was explaining to group of female congressional candidates why she did not retire after She intended to do so after Hillary Clinton won Ms Pelosi recalled Wednesday at Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reception here But she stayed to ensure Washington had at least one woman in power To some lawmakers in the room who described her remarks the message was clear Ms Pelosi is not going anywhere point she underscored in an interview Yet her resolve is at odds with growing numbers of Democratic candidates who view her as politically toxic and are pledging to vote against her as their leader as Mr Lamb did without suffering consequences with voters and donors These candidates and some current   Democrats tired of years of attack ads invoking Ms Pelosi as San Francisco liberal and impatient to see younger set of leaders take power are now openly distancing themselves from Ms Pelosi or declaring outright that it is time for her to go Mr Lamb by coming out early against Ms Pelosi and scoring an upset win in district President Trump carried by nearly percentage points has clearly emboldened some other Democrats to follow suit and disavow her Republicans intend to make Ms Pelosi unpopularity centerpiece of their strategy hoping that her polarizing status will mitigate their predicted losses Anticipating this strategy from the right Democratic candidates are increasingly opposing her as speaker or refusing to take stand as an act of political inoculation trend that even her allies acknowledge   ultimately imperil her grip on the Democratic caucus At least two other senior Democrats Representatives Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Joseph Crowley of New York are already actively laying the groundwork to seek the leader job if Ms Pelosi position becomes untenable As Democratic   candidates descended on Washington last week for round of training and fund raising the topic of how to confront the Pelosi question came up repeatedly according to multiple officials was just in and that the advice everybody gives Don say you re for Pelosi recalled former Representative Brad Ashford Nebraska Democrat trying to reclaim his seat He   not rule out backing Ms Pelosi Most ominous for Ms Pelosi it is not just centrist candidates running in red tinged districts who are reluctant to embrace her but also political insurgents on the left who see her as an embodiment of the Washington establishment   have to see who running said Marie Newman progressive Democratic   candidate in Illinois when asked if she   support Ms Pelosi for speaker Ms Newman is vying to unseat Representative Daniel Lipinski conservative Chicago Democrat in primary there on Tuesday And on Capitol Hill Ms Pelosi must contend with colleagues from her own generation who want their turn in charge as well as younger Democrats who prefer to clear out the party entire septuagenarian leadership team beyond Ms Pelosi the other two ranking   Democrats Mr Hoyer and James Clyburn are and Yet at time when women are at the forefront of the opposition to Mr Trump presidency volunteering donating and running for office in record numbers the specter of Democrats taking back the   only to unceremoniously dump the most powerful woman in American politics strikes many in the party as outrageous And Ms Pelosi herself is plainly in this camp woman at the table she said in the interview Friday before getting on plane for Houston where she was going to

Democrats needed her in charge am master legislator am shrewd politician and have following in the country that apart from presidential candidate nobody else can claim she said While she   not firmly commit to seeking the speakership again it is clearly her plan and she even gave voice to concern on the minds of many Democrats the chaotic scramble that   ensue if she steps down If was to walk away now this caucus   be in such musical chairs scenario she said Even as energy on the left has soared across the country thanks to Mr Trump tensions among   Democrats are brewing inside the Capitol Should Democrats fail to reclaim the   in year with so many factors in their favor Ms Pelosi and her long serving lieutenants will almost certainly be pushed to step down Yet some in the caucus want to see new leadership no matter what Representative Bill Pascrell Jr Democrat of New Jersey hosted Mr Crowley at St Patrick Day themed event last week and unexpectedly announced that he   back Mr Crowley for leader Mr Pascrell said the culture of the   was changing lot of new people will be coming in and think we should start fresh Mr Pascrell said adding almost apologetically of Ms Pelosi She taken lot of crap from Republicans and Democrats and she really been above it all Representative Filemon Vela Texas Democrat said he had also encouraged Mr Crowley to run for speaker ImageLawmakers say Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland has pitched himself as steady Democratic leader through the elections CreditGabriella Demczuk for The   Having Joe be the leader of this party next session   be welcome change said Mr Vela adding that Ms Pelosi hurts our candidates in competitive districts For his part Mr Crowley has been inviting groups of younger lawmakers to meet for coffee and pastries in his office reaching out to high profile newer members like Joaquin Castro of Texas and Joseph Kennedy III of Massachusetts In an interview Mr Crowley declined to rule out taking on Ms Pelosi Asked if he was seeking commitments for future race Mr Crowley said only that have been talking to my colleagues about what they and we can do to help put us in the majority Ms Pelosi dismissed the idea of challenge from Mr Crowley who briefly considered challenging her after the election and her aides pointedly noted that at an event in New York last week he introduced her as soon to be speaker again Mr Hoyer in turn has pitched himself to colleagues as transitional   speaker according to multiple lawmakers who have spoken with him steady hand through the elections and perhaps no further Katie Grant his spokeswoman said he was focused on taking back the   Part of Ms Pelosi challenge owes to the changing nature of fund raising Mr Lamb raised over million from mostly online contributors the same way other Democrats are attracting donations That has raised questions about just how much Ms Pelosi vaunted fund raising prowess still matters It weakens the leverage of party leaders

Democratic   candidate in Illinois said   have to see who running CreditSara Burnett Associated PressYet some Democrats predicted that if the party rides an electoral wave back to power Ms Pelosi   reap much of the credit If we take the majority completely assume that Leader Pelosi will be Speaker Pelosi said Representative Karen Bass Democrat of California The most plausible scenario for Ms Pelosi to exit Democrats believe is one in which the party just barely wins control of the   number of new lawmakers   have pledged not to vote for her and several Democrats oppose her as matter of routine potentially denying her the votes needed to secure the speakership think it will be left up to the new membership said Representative John Lewis of Georgia noting that freshman lawmakers and the rest of the caucus should work their will That   doom Ms Pelosi e ly if more Democrats follow Mr Lamb approach At least three of the Democrats red to blue candidates recruits designated as top priorities by the have signaled they   prefer leader other than Ms Pelosi In Minnesota Dean Phillips wealthy businessman challenging Representative Erik Paulsen Republican has called for new

 formidable achievement She was tenacious legislator But one characteristic that distinguished her from many in the current polarized environment is that while she might strenuously differ with her opponents she didn hold them in contempt or dismiss them out of hand She fulfilled the old political maxim of being able to disagree without being disagreeable Really the thing that keep coming back to is how she was tough but unfailingly gracious said Speaker Paul Ryan as he ordered the flags at the Capitol to be lowered to half staff in tribute to Ms Slaughter the only woman to lead the Rules

  bySnap to Tweak Snapchat Redesign After Users ComplainImageLate last year Snapchat began separating chats and stories from friends from the content of media properties Its parent company said the redesign was major reason for disappointing earnings report on Tuesday CreditSnapchatBy Nellie BowlesMay SAN FRANCISCO When Snapchat app was redesigned late last year viral rage gripped its passionate and young users The social media star Kylie Jenner tweeted that she had not been using the app as much and called the changes sad More than million people signed Change org petition to get the company to return the app to its old design complaint on Twitter about the Snapchat redesign became one of the most retweeted messages of all time On Tuesday Snapchat parent company Snap said it   redesign parts of the app redesign after the overhaul had dragged down its business For the first three months of the year the social media company reported Tuesday it posted narrower loss than year earlier and percent increase in revenue to million which was below analyst expectations While Snap number of daily users rose to million in the quarter that figure was also below what Wall Street had anticipated And the company said its user numbers in March were even lower though it did not release them Evan Spiegel Snap chief executive cited Snapchat redesign as major reason for the disappointing performance change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption he said referring later to headwinds from the redesign The quarterly results which sent Snap stock plunging more than percent in after hours trading were reversal from the previous quarter when the social media company had finally appeared to shrug off its losing streak with strong sales and user growth Snap which went public in March and is often seen as competitor to Facebook has been grappling with inconsistent results casting cloud over its prospects The latest earnings indicated that Snap had not been able to capitalize on the woes of Facebook which has been dealing with backlash over data privacy Facebook said last week that it had added million monthly active users in the first quarter bringing it to billion So now Snap will tweak its redesign Snapchat began as an app to send disappearing messages to friends but it later added professional content from media companies and other features When the company changed the app last year the goal was to separate chats and stories from friends from the content of media properties such as celebrities and publications In practice that meant Snapchat had two sides The left side of the app featured chats and stories shared with or by people friends On the right side was content from publishers amateur creators and celebrities and stories that Snap curated from user generated videos and  s The goal was to expand the more lucrative media side of the business and to increase the app appeal to an older demographic But over the past few months the changes diluted the core chat experience which became cluttered with user stories Snapchat users who are mostly young quickly rebelled Snap has their back against the wall said Daniel Ives the head of technology research for GBH Insights They need to work with their user community Now the company is moving stories made by friends back to the side of the app that also has media content This change is aimed at decluttering the app chat function The pivots have some analysts worried about Mr Spiegel leadership of Snap What looking for is some direction said Richard Greenfield media and technology analyst at BTIG Evan was so decisive in that your friends are distinct from influencers you re not friends with Kim Kardashian so she shouldn be in your friends list and yet now they seem to be wavering on that Content rather than chat is where the monetization potential is Mr Greenfield added Anthony DiClemente an analyst at Evercore ISI said The app redesign is question and an open debate He added don know that the Snap leadership has proven itself to such degree that you have high conviction long term investors in the stock right now Even as Snap growth disappoints the company is spending lot of money which is another area of concern for investors The company spent million in the first quarter as it moved from Venice Calif to new office in Santa Monica Calif up from million in expenses the previous quarter They re spending money like rock star Mr Ives said Mr Spiegel was unapologetic about the changes to Snapchat app When we build products we re not just thinking about what our community is going to like to use right away he said in conference call on Tuesday We re thinking lot about how our products will help us accomplish our mission

  byWhat Border Agents Say They Want It Not Wall ImagePresident Trump in San Diego last week to inspect prototypes for border wall Days after his inauguration last year Mr Trump ordered construction to begin immediately on wall CreditDoug Mills The  By Ron NixonMarch WASHINGTON President Trump has called for wall along the border with Mexico to stop undocumented immigrants and drugs from entering the United States But Border Patrol agents on the front lines say they need more technology and additional personnel to curb the illegal traffic according to report released on Thursday by Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security Committee The report was based on internal Customs and Border Protection documents from the fiscal year It concluded that less than one half of percent of the agents suggestions to secure the Southwest border mentioned the need for wall Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri the committee top Democrat said the report reinforced what she had previously heard from border agents and leaders at Customs and Border Protection the parent agency of the Border Patrol We can let politics get in the way of our efforts to strengthen border security and protect our country said Ms McCaskill referring to Mr Trump promises to build border wall Officials at Customs and Border Protection called the report inaccurate saying it confused how agents feedback about security vulnerabilities is used to develop programs to counter threats The documents show that the Border Patrol identified what it called capability gaps or vulnerabilities on the Southwest border The word wall was suggested as possible solution for just three of those gaps Agents mentioned fence or fencing as possible solution   less than percent of the vulnerabilities identified the report found Customs and Border Protection officials said Border Patrol agents were asked to identify gaps in border security not to propose solutions They said that Border Patrol sector chiefs from San Diego to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas have voiced support for border wall Days after his inauguration last year Mr Trump ordered construction to begin immediately on border wall Customs and Border Protection then created process to help decide where wall was most needed on the border and for how many miles The Border Patrol has been very clear that border wall is essential to gaining operational control of the Southwest border said Benjamine Huffman the chief of the Border Patrol strategic plan and analysis directorate The fact is when it comes to border security the border walls system works Suggestions that the Border Patrol believes otherwise are false The Senate Democrats report comes as Mr Trump is stepping up his calls for building border wall On Monday in New Hampshire where he outlined plans to fight opioid abuse the president again said that building wall   block drugs from entering the United States We ll build the wall to keep the damn drugs out he said Last year Customs and Border Protection spent million on border wall prototypes near San Diego Agency officials said they have been testing the mock ups to decide which best curbed illegal immigration and drug trafficking Congressional Democrats and some Republicans including Representative Will Hurd of Texas have questioned the need for wall and instead called for more technology along the border such as sensors and surveillance equipment February study by the Government Accountability Office found that Customs and Border Protection had not shown the extent to which fencing and walls have secured the border The   on Thursday approved spending money on border fencing but not border wall The bill   fund nearly billion for border security including technology and repairs to existing barriers That includes million for about miles of new border fencing in the Rio Grande Valley The administration wants to spend billion over the next years to build wall on nearly miles of the Southwest border Currently there are nearly miles of wall and fences on the border The Democratic report concluded that funding requests for wall far exceeded proposed spending on border technology and personnel which border agents identified as critically needed The president budget request for the fiscal year includes million for remote video surveillance systems along the border and more funding for other security technology It also includes million to hire and retain agents at the Border Patrol which has been shedding personnel faster than it can hire Agency documents indicate the Border Patrol must recruit applicants to fill single agent position Mr Trump wants to hire new agents program to detect drug tunnels beneath the southern border another security priority cited by agents was not funded

AdvertisementOpinionSupported byA New Face Won Change the British Government Racist HeartBy Maya GoodfellowMs Goodfellow writes about immigration race and British politics May ImageProtesters angered by the Windrush scandal outside Parliament this week CreditAndy Rain European Press  Agency via ShutterstockLONDON When government is in crisis frequent tactic to limit damage is rebranding New logo new policy name or new faces Some  it works It looks like meaningful response But more often than not rebrands don mean substantive change This is what Prime Minister Theresa May is hoping the British public won notice with her appointment this week of Sajid Javid as the new home secretary Drafted to replace Amber Rudd who inadvertently misled members of Parliament over targets for deporting undocumented immigrants Mr Javid has been given the job of sorting out the so called Windrush scandal revelations that the Home Office which oversees immigration enforcement had been deporting people who moved to Britain from Caribbean colonies in the at the invitation of the government Some years later the Home Office has said these people no longer have the right paperwork to stay in the country The revelations have laid bare the government incompetence and cruelty Within hours of Mr Javid appointment the BBC declared that one advantage he should have is his background His parents came to this country from Pakistan As he told one newspaper they have something in common with the Windrush families It   have been me my mum or my dad he said obviously different part of the world from South Asia not the Caribbean but other than that similar in almost every way ImageSajid Javid the new British home secretary CreditAndy Rain European Press  Agency via ShutterstockIt possible that Mr Javid background will grant him more empathy than his predecessors had But his family hi  alone doesn equal the change that Britain desperately needs when it comes to immigration policy The reaction to Mr Javid appointment reveals serious problem with how many people seem to understand politics He is the first person of color to lead the Home Office some cheered him for breaking that barrier Of course representation isn entirely inconsequential But for too many there is desire to reduce anti racism and anti sexism to issues of representation If we get more women or people of color into positions of power society will become more equal You   call this trickle down equality and like its economic counterpart it doesn work There are two lessons to learn from Mr Javid appointment The fight against an unjust immigration system does not change with new home secretary and if we remain satisfied with representation as the sole means of progress diversity becomes shield for government institutionally racist policies Hostility to immigration is at the heart of Mrs May government Before she became prime minister Mrs May was the home secretary In that role she pledged to get net migration down to the tens of thousands Told it was unworkable she stubbornly stuck with it It was and  s to be her mission in the words of the Conservative Party manifesto to bear down on immigration It with this in mind that the government has fulfilled the pledge Mrs May made in to create really hostile environment for illegal immigrants The state has denied people health care jobs housing and even bank account if they don have the right papers The Home Office has even denied visas to doctors from India recruited by the National Health Service to fill empty posts Mr Javid was there when all of this was happening supporting Mrs May His parliamentary record reads as unencumbered support for his government punitive immigration policies He voted for the very changes that make up the hostile environment So is there any reason to assume he   do anything other than   to carry out cruel Conservative immigration policy It was the policies Mr Javid voted for that removed protection for long term residents from deportation and meant that without four pieces of evidence for every year they ve been in the country people of the Windrush generation were deported denied potentially lifesaving medical treatment lost their jobs and their homes and were stripped of their dignity But rebranding is all the rage this week With new home secretary came new policy title Mr Javid will ditch the term hostile environment in favor of the more pleasant sounding compliant environment The Windrush generation will be helped the Conservatives will try to soften their image But the policies that led to this appalling affair will stay in place People the government classifies as illegal will still be treated with contempt and someone   still easily end up deported just because of misplaced paper or change in the rules exactly what happened to the Windrush generation This will deter people from speaking out if they fall into trouble it will make people less likely to seek help for diseases and it will   to catch all manner of people in its net regardless of the specifics of their situation Changing the title of Home Office policy is not the same as changing how it works neither is changing the minister Without an end to the hostile environment and the government inhumane approach to immigration which treats every person thought to be migrant with suspicion Mr Javid appointment doesn alter

AdvertisementOpinionSupported byCan Australia Regulate Intra Office Sex By Waleed AlyMarch ImageFormer Australian Nationals party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce center looks down while sitting in parliament in Canberra Monday Feb Joyce quit as party leader and deputy prime minister over sexual harassment allegation CreditRod McGuirk Associated PressMELBOURNE Australia Australian politics these days feels like   in People magazine Political journalism indeed Parliament itself has been reduced to forum for rumors about sex It all began in February with the sensational news that Barnaby Joyce then deputy prime minister had been having an affair with an aide who is now pregnant Eventually Mr Joyce resigned from his leadership post and retreated to the backbench But the government response to the scandal ensured it   linger on Having initially insisted that Mr Joyce predicament was private matter Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull swiftly changed his view and introduced formal ban on sex between ministers and their staff This might seem like straightforward acknowledgment of the power imbalances within government official office But in truth it has meant that what might have been footnote in Australian political hi  has instead set off the degradation of the country political culture consensual sexual relationship between minister and staff member has become firing offense like corruption or conflict of interest Every rumor of intra office sex is now fair game for inquiry from the press and Parliament Sex is now officially matter of public interest This   only have deleterious effect on politics And sure enough that what has happened Days after Mr Joyce resignation Michaelia Cash the minister for jobs and innovation from the conservative Liberal Party was being interrogated in hearing unrelated to the Joyce scandal or intra office sex when she declared that Bill Shorten leader of the opposition Labor Party has been the subject of rumors for years concerning presumably sexual relationships with his female staff members This outburst   only have occurred in the context of the Joyce matter The home affairs minister Peter Dutton made this explicit when he defended Ms Cash in radio interview We ve sat here taking morals lecture from Bill Shorten in relation to Barnaby Joyce over the last few weeks and people know that there hi  of problems in Bill Shorten personal life he said And to be lectured by the Labor Party really sticks in the craw But the truth is that the morals lecture came from Mr Turnbull Labor response throughout Mr Joyce travails has been studiously amoral focused on questions of whether his relationship had led him to abuse public funds or whether the prime minister approved the transfer of Mr Joyce former employee to other ministerial offices Only when the prime minister made the affair itself civil wrong by changing the office code of conduct for ministers did he make Ms Cash comments politically meaningful smear The real problem here is not that Ms Cash and Mr Joyce exercised poor judgment Politicians have been doing that for centuries It that within this new political culture Mr Joyce   expect punishment for consensual affair and that Ms Cash was saying something squarely relevant Every political journalist now has duty to explore sexual rumors and politicians have duty to investigate them In just the past few days we ve seen the National Party of Australia decide to quiz prospective candidates about their sex lives including visits to brothels or swingers clubs and any relationships that   compromise them if they became public Mr Turnbull attempt to deal with the power imbalances inherent between ministers and their staff was probably well intentioned And concern about sex and power in ministers offices is utterly reasonable But we can regulate office sexual conduct in way that doesn transform sexual behavior into matter of public interest Any rules will be impossible to police except through the most corrosive and intrusive means And that is before we even consider that to impose ban like this is to dismiss the agency of the staff members And it ignores the many perfectly sound relationships to come from such unbalanced circumstances Already one independent member of Parliament is proposing that the ban on office sex cover all politicians not just ministers But why stop there There is often power imbalance between people of different ages Should we start regulating relationships characterized by an age gap Or relationships characterized by class disparity It is unlikely that Mr Turnbull will ever reverse the sex ban He has taken too strong moral stand on it and the ban has enough public support to make revisiting it risky political move Even the Labor Party which had criticized the policy wound up pledging to keep it if it takes control of the government That is shame policy that makes office sex legitimate focus of journalistic and even political energy promises to do major disservice in the long run Australian politics might have become little more sensationalistic through all this And it has gotten little smaller too Waleed Aly is

AdvertisementOpinionSupported byOp Ed ContributorsIs Trump Giving Authoritarianism Bad Name By Lee Drutman Larry Diamond and Joe GoldmanMarch ImagePresident Trump at the White   last month CreditTom Brenner The  In the past two years wave of distressing commentary has stressed the fragility of American democracy and the potential inspired by President Trump for emerging authoritarianism But year into the Trump administration Americans are rejecting authoritarian alternatives to democracy In new survey by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group we found that the percentage of Americans who expressed support for strong leader who doesn have to bother with elections or Congress fell to levels not seen since the mid In particular young people overwhelmingly reject authoritarian rule despite concerns about rising generation retreating from democracy raised most prominently by Roberto Foa and Yascha Mounk Mr Trump is almost certainly giving authoritarianism bad name Support for authoritarian rule declined most among Democrats and young people while significantly increasing among Republicans So when it comes to American authoritarianism perhaps the problem isn so much Mr Trump as it is hyper partisanship Support for authoritarian leadership is concentrating in the Republican Party and its elites are doing little to push back In our highly polarized two party system this poses the risk that future partisan conflict   become battle over democracy itself Mr Trump illiberal style of politics fits the authoritarian leanings of significant portion of his electoral base Support for strong leader who doesn have to bother with Congress or elections is much higher among Trump primary voters percent than among voters for any other primary candidate Republican or Democrat Even more authoritarian are the voters who switched from Barack Obama in to Mr Trump in Forty five percent of them support strong leader and percent don agree that democracy is preferable to any other kind of government The supporters of authoritarian leadership tend to be the least educated and the most culturally conservative They re much more likely to say that being of European heritage is very important to being an American and that we should increase surveillance of mosques and single out Muslims for airport screenings To the extent that this mix of attitudes is defining feature of Trumpism and Trumpism is taking over the Republican Party this presents serious challenge to American democracy Many Americans identify as Republicans and most of the time voters look to their party leaders to tell them what they should think about the issues Thanks to strong support from conservative media and explicit or implicit support from Republicans in Congress Mr Trump is redefining what it means to be Republican We don know yet how much his leadership will erode support for democracy among his loyal base but without powerful conservative voices offering an alternative vision of what it means to be Republican it unlikely that most Trump voters will push back on his illiberal impulses on their own We worry what might happen if Mr Trump stokes well honed Republican concerns about voter fraud as the November midterm elections approach If Republicans lose the   or the Senate based on few close contests will Mr Trump challenge the results and encourage his partisan supporters to do the same At the very least Mr Trump  d anti system illiberal appeals which surface whenever he campaigns   to energize his base his recent performance in Pennsylvania is good example The highly polarized state of our two party system accentuates the danger If Mr Trump transgresses more seriously against democratic norms many Republicans might go along with him simply out of distrust of or enmity toward the Democrats And many others might simply disengage from politics unhappy with either alternative and deeply frustrated with the whole political system This creates its own set of problems since we also find like many before us that those who are most disengaged from politics are no great lovers of democracy Still to return to the good news for moment Public support for democracy as good or very good system has returned to historic high in the past two decades percent as has the proportion percent attaching great importance to living in democracy We don take our good news as cause for comfort The lesson we draw from our data and from the current global democratic recession is that democracy is not self sustaining It depends on public commitment to its essential values pluralism mutual respect and tolerance flexibility critical thinking and willingness to compromise These must be renewed with every generation through civic education And they must be modeled and defended by political leaders and other elites on all sides who have always been the most important teachers and sustainers of democracy Lee Drutman senior fellow at New America is the

Supported by Economy Gig Economy Business Model Dealt Blow in California Ruling By NOAM SCHEIBERAPRIL     the main   Share This Page     the main     An Uber sticker above one for its ride hailing rival Lyft Even if ruling like California eventually forces such companies to change their business model that moment   be far off Credit Richard Vogel Associated Press In ruling with potentially sweeping consequences for the so called gig economy the California Supreme Court on Monday made it much more difficult for companies to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees The decision   eventually require companies like Uber many of which are based in California to follow minimum wage and overtime laws and to pay workers compensation and unemployment insurance and payroll taxes potentially upending their business models Industry executives have estimated that classifying drivers and other gig workers as employees tends to cost to percent more than classifying them as contractors It also brings benefits that can offset these costs though like the ability to control schedules and the manner of work It massive thing definitely game changer that will force everyone to take fresh look at the whole issue said Richard Meneghello co chairman of the gig economy practice group at the management side law firm Fisher Phillips Advertisement     the main   The court essentially scrapped the existing test for determining employee status which was used to assess the degree of control over the worker That test hinged on roughly factors like the amount of supervision and whether the worker   be fired without cause     the main   Advertisement     the main   In its place the court erected much simpler ABC test that is applied in Massachusetts and New Jersey Under that test the worker is considered an employee if he or she performs job that is part of the usual course of the company business By way of an example the court said plumber hired by store to fix bathroom leak   not reasonably be considered an employee of that store But seamstresses sewing at home using materials provided by clothing manufacturer   probably be considered employees In addition company must show that it does not control and direct the worker and that the worker is truly an independent business operator not just classified that way unilaterally While companies like Uber have had some success arguing that they don exert sufficient control over drivers to be considered employers it   be hard to assert that drivers are performing task that isn

example California judge found that food delivery was regular part of the company business in Los Angeles where the plaintiff worked potentially satisfying the ABC test But she ruled in favor of the company concluding that it did not exert sufficient control over the worker to be considered an employer Shannon Liss Riordan the attorney for the plaintiff in that case said she   seek reconsideration in light of the new ruling GrubHub said in statement that it was aware of Monday ruling but   not comment because of the appeals process in the case other than to say it will   to ensure delivery partners can take advantage of the flexibility they value from working with our company Uber declined to comment The case on which the court ruled Monday was brought by delivery drivers at company called Dynamex who had been considered employees before when the company changed the relationship to contracting arrangement Advertisement     the main   Were the courts to find that workers at companies like GrubHub and Uber as now constituted were employees rather than contractors the companies   respond in several ways They   simply make their workers employees rather than contactors Alternatively ride hailing companies like Uber might choose to rein in their operations providing more limited platform in which drivers and passengers can negotiate prices and the terms of the service Even if Uber and the like are eventually forced to change their business model however that moment   be far off Uber drivers typically sign an arbitration agreement stating that any disputes must be brought individually and outside the court system While the United States Supreme Court recently heard challenge to such agreements it is widely expected to uphold them version of

big recess plans to wind down from her hectic first months as chairwoman of the Rules Committee after the Democratic takeover of the   that January Well Carl she said with sigh having colonoscopy Monday and you know what the preparation for that is like As that offhand remark illustrates Ms Slaughter did not hold much back from either personal or political standpoint Her death last week at after fall at her home in Washington cost Congress one of its unique personalities rare lawmaker who was respected admired and held in great affection by members of both parties even as she served in one of the most partisan positions in the   Known universally to her colleagues simply as Louise Ms Slaughter was remarkable figure in many ways She was trailblazer for women when entering politics was difficult and male counterparts   treat them with disdain and disrespect She was revered champion of women rights She was also recognizable for the lilt of her native Kentucky accent but still managed to get elected to her Rochester centered district in upstate   formidable achievement Advertisement     the main   She was tenacious legislator But one characteristic that distinguished her from many in the current polarized environment is that while she might strenuously differ with her opponents she didn hold them in contempt or dismiss them out of hand She fulfilled the old political

at the Capitol to be lowered to half staff in tribute to Ms Slaughter the only woman to lead the Rules Committee She was simply great     the main   Advertisement     the main   That is not how speakers of one party typically talk about one of their chief adversaries in the other even in   of grief But Ms Slaughter whose funeral is set for Friday in Rochester had earned it We have some very divisive battles in the Rules Committee but think she genuinely liked and appreciated everyone on that committee said Representative Jim McGovern Democrat of Massachusetts who served alongside Ms Slaughter on the panel for years We have these big fights and she   be asking someone How your son your father your mother and tell them to try her homemade cures But when the gavel went down she was fighter said Mr McGovern who   have been remiss had he not mentioned Ms Slaughter regularly showing up with home baked pies She had this talent where she was determined and forceful but she also had sense of humor and knew how to charm people and get her point across She was very very effective Tensions can run high at meetings of the Rules Committee one of the original committees of the   and the forum where the majority party gets to exercise its muscle in setting the parameters of floor debate With its to membership breakdown it is heavily weighted toward the majority and the minority can often get angry and frustrated as majority lawmakers essentially fix the debate to their advantage It often meets at odd hours and in rushed circumstances exacerbating the partisan sniping Both as chairwoman and the top member of the minority Ms Slaughter found ways to keep things on an even keel   Ms Slaughter during Rules Committee hearing in She remains the only woman to have led the committee Credit Alex Wong Getty Images She was force to be reckoned with who always brought her spunk fire and dynamic leadership to every meeting said Representative Pete Sessions Republican of Texas who now leads the panel and jousted with Ms Slaughter for years Louise was fearless leader deeply committed to her constituents and dear friend He added that he   always cherish our friendship camaraderie and of course her rhubarb pie Advertisement     the main   Perhaps Ms Slaughter biggest moment in the limelight was during   machinations over the health care bill in The loss of crucial th vote in the Senate with the death of Edward Kennedy had handcuffed   Democrats who had no choice but to pass Senate bill with some provisions they didn like if they wanted to send bill to the White   To limit the political pain Democrats cooked up an approach that   have essentially deemed the bill passed under what is known in Congress as self executing rule allowing Democrats to avoid direct vote on those objectionable provisions Though Republicans had done the same thing in the past they howled and mocked Ms Slaughter with catchy phrases such as Slaughter   Rules Democrats eventually came up with another approach but Republicans  d to complain leading the plain spoken Ms Slaughter to fire back that their convoluted dispute over procedure was just subterfuge In reality it about blocking much needed health care reform in this nation she said Those who oppose the process don want any debate or votes on health care itself They just want to make reform go away In recent years one of her top priorities was an ethics measure intended to prevent lawmakers and other federal officials from profiting in the stock market from inside knowledge This was one instance that cost her some friends in the   Representative Chris Collins Republican from neighboring New York district described her to Fox News as despicable human being after she complained to   ethics watchdogs about his efforts on behalf of biotech company in which he owned stock Ms Slaughter the oldest member of the   at her death had been weighing re election and was being encouraged to run again and perhaps regain her chairmanship should Democrats take back the   Mr McGovern said her energy and optimism remained high She genuinely loved this institution she loved Congress and she cared deeply about

More than million people signed Change org petition to get the company to return the app to its old design complaint on Twitter about the Snapchat redesign became one of the most retweeted messages of all time On Tuesday Snapchat parent company Snap said it   redesign parts of the app redesign after the overhaul had dragged down its business For the first three months of the year the social media

Snapchat began as an app to send disappearing messages to friends but it later added professional content from media companies and other features When the company changed the app last year the goal was to separate chats and stories from friends from the content of media properties such as celebrities and publications In practice that meant Snapchat had two sides The left side of the app featured chats and stories shared with or by people friends On the right side was content from publishers amateur creators and celebrities and stories that Snap curated from user generated videos and  s The goal was to expand the more lucrative media side of the business and to increase the app appeal to an older demographic But over the past few months the changes diluted the core chat experience which became cluttered with user stories Snapchat users who are mostly young quickly rebelled Snap has their back against the wall said Daniel Ives the head of technology research for GBH Insights They need to work with their user community Advertisement     the main   Now the company is moving stories made by friends back to the side of the app that also has media content This change is aimed at decluttering the app chat function The pivots have some analysts worried about Mr Spiegel leadership of Snap What looking for is some direction said Richard Greenfield media and technology analyst at BTIG Evan was so decisive in that your friends are distinct from influencers you re not friends with Kim Kardashian so she shouldn be in your friends list and yet now they seem to be wavering on that Content rather than chat is where the monetization potential is Mr Greenfield added Anthony DiClemente an analyst at Evercore ISI said The app redesign is question and an open debate He added don know that the Snap leadership has proven itself to such degree that you have high conviction long term investors in the stock right now Even as Snap growth disappoints the company is spending lot of money which is another area of concern for investors The company spent million in the first quarter as it moved from Venice Calif to new office in Santa Monica Calif up from million in expenses the previous quarter They re spending money like rock star Mr Ives said Mr Spiegel was unapologetic about the changes to Snapchat app When we build products we re not just thinking about what our community is going to like to use right away he said in conference call on Tuesday We re thinking lot about how our products will help us accomplish our mission Follow Nellie Bowles on Twitter NellieBowles version
