advertisementsupported byq tell us things about your book inside the fevered minds of sports fansby john williamsfeb imagecreditpatricia wall the  if you ve never had your heart broken or your nerves thoroughly frayed by sporting event you know someone who has as young journalist at the los angeles   in the george dohrmann   field late night phone calls from rabid fans he wondered being fan himself why the depth of their devotion mystified him my blindness to the root causes of their thinking and conduct was also ignorance about myself he writes in his new book superfans into the heart of obsessive sports fandom dohrmann who spent time as an investigative reporter at sports illustrated and is now senior editor at the athletic spoke to everyday fans academics and scientists about what it is that drives our vicarious competitive mania below he talks about whether kids should be fans his admiration for the soccer player clint dempsey and more when did you first get the idea to write this book it long been curiosity of mine why people were so intense about their favorite team certainly had my favorites throughout my life as young person it was notre dame football and growing up in california the giants in baseball and the warriors in basketball most of those teams fell away but what became my one true obsession was the united states men national soccer team but never on the level that   see from people both as young journalist and then later when was doing investigative journalism on colleges getting death threats from fans who were upset what is it that makes people this passionate love sports too but how did they get there then had kids have an eight year old and five year old and started asking myself about fandom and how to introduce it to them it all came together three or four years ago it felt like the moment professionally and personally for me to dive into this book there are so many books that explore someone individual fandom but those aren that accessible if not red sox fan not going to read book about red sox fan thought if you wrote something that introduced different people from around the country that was more approachable way to analyze fandom what the most surprising thing you learned while writing it imagegeorge dohrmanncreditadam moorei talked to susan harter renowned child psychologist about how kids receive their parents fandom she told me that we shouldn be introducing our kids to fandom until adolescence this runs contrary to what we do we put baby in green bay packers onesie this is what we see all the time and we celebrate it posting pictures of it and saying how cute it is but kid wrote about an eagles fan was just melting down in youtube videos while the patriots were beating his team harter said kids want to see the world in black and white they want to divide the world into good and bad and sports does that but the kids don understand that the fact that their teacher is an auburn fan doesn make them bad person they don understand that daddy going to be when his team loses they lack perspective they can say well it been good season even though we lost this game some  now watch game outside the home so my kids don see me yelling at the tv and see that it important to me don want them to make it important right now in what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write initially wanted to have more fan athlete engagement in the book more opportunities for athletes to confront the fans who often say critical things about them thought that   make for good   and did reach out to some athletes but ultimately concluded that part of fandom blazing is what they call it that troll behavior while it exists it felt like falling into trap just looking at the worst of fans there is some bad behavior in the book but it felt too voyeuristic to keep highlighting these really extreme negative fans who is creative person not writer who has influenced you and your work for long time my favorite national team player was clint dempsey liked him because he was successful but loved how he was successful and why loved that he grew up poor and had to go outside the traditional soccer development system he wasn put on the conveyor belt to greatness that inspiring someone who works outside the system and still gets to the top of it he   take risks on the field it was like he was saying going to try for greatness and might look foolish some  and it might not work out but going to shoot for greatness here that was something to love and admire about him and something that anyone can bring into their own work we have to take shots here persuade someone to read superfans in words or less lot of people wonder about sports fans behavior they might be husbands wives brothers sisters roommates girlfriends boyfriends these people ask why are they like that this book will open your eyes so wide to that behavior and you ll be able to tick off the

france presse getty imagesby rebecca ruizdec lausanne switzerland what do you think about your new president you are shocked the man posing the question to me was mikhail kusnirovich owner of russia largest department store he and donald trump had tried to strike deal to bring the miss universe pageant to red square years before he said he went on to answer his own question think he going to be good it was december in mr kusnirovich office overlooking the kremlin weeks before united states intelligence agencies   publicly conclude that russia had interfered in the election in the interest of tilting it toward mr trump nesting dolls with the american president elect face stared out of stalls at the holiday markets but the topic at hand for me was not election meddling but rather russia sophisticated cheating at the winter olympics in sochi russia two subversions of global sports and american democracy have more in common than you may think both involve intelligence agents russia will to win and the same cyberespionage team both have prompted millions of dollars of investigations and challenged public confidence in the purity of sport and in the strength of democracy the two breaches are at the heart of how president vladimir putin has suggested he wants to reclaim russia past by weakening western democracy and dominating world sports mr kusnirovich belonged to group of prominent public figures focused on restoring russian sports to good global standing the group was created last summer by mr putin after revelations that the nation had stolen medals in sochi by relying on steroid laced martinis hundreds of ounces of stockpiled clean urine and the overnight stealth of the country federal security service the kremlin dismissed the details of both schemes as absurd but on tuesday russia was barred from the winter games for its state backed cheating some individual russian athletes may compete independently in neutral uniforms but the russian flag will not appear when the games begin in pyeongchang south korea the details of the sports scandal deconstructed by russian whistle blowers who have provided rare insider insights offer perhaps the purest case study of russia drive to dominate its brazen methods and in part its motivation to influence the american presidency in declassified intelligence report released early this year united states officials said russia attacks on the election had been for mr putin partial payback for the doping scandal which he repeatedly called an american led effort to defame russia last month as new medals were stripped from russian olympians mr putin said the disqualifications were the united states attempt to undermine his re election in fact sports regulators and investigators who conducted the multiple investigations into russia doping are headquartered in canada and the olympic leadership in charge of disqualifying athletes is based in switzerland it was the former president of that staunchly neutral country samuel schmid who conducted the latest investigation for the olympic committee resulting in tuesday sanctions in scrutinizing russia sports and antidoping officials have said they acted on objective forensic and scientific evidence of russia fraud documents data lab analyses and glass bottles of urine with telltale signs of tampering just as allies of the   counsel robert mueller have done this year in the context of the election inquiry the officials have defended their impartiality and interest in plain facts three key whistle blowers helped provide those facts grigory rodchenkov russia former longtime chief antidoping chemist as well as yuliya and vitaly stepanov former russian runner and former employee of the nation antidoping agency all now live in the united states in undisclosed locations from which they have spoken openly about years of coordinated cheating the justice department too has taken interest in their evidence dr rodchenkov whose personal diaries cataloged each day of cheating in sochi came to the united states only after vitaly mutko russia deputy prime minister and former sports minister asked him to resign in light of growing global suspicions about the extent of the nation cheating which the chemist had helped mastermind   we also have meeting how to come from defensive to offensive dr rodchenkov wrote to me in an email on nov having initially denied wrongdoing in our early exchanges at that meeting mr mutko effectively dismissed him and set off dramatic chain of events freedom he wrote in another email that night dr rodchenkov tell all account reported in the   in may and detailed in the documentary icarus culminated in russia olympic ban this week it was instrumental in motivating some russian officials to temper their rigid denials and acknowledge that an institutional conspiracy had existed though they maintained it had not been state sponsored still before this week final sanctions were announced global athletes antidoping advocates and some sponsors had expressed concern about growing crisis in international sports pointing to the long delay by both regulators and olympic officials in responding to evidence of widespread cheating that went even beyond sochi as those critics wondered when or if sports officials   penalize russia for its systematic transgressions by rescinding olympic medals and condemning the state supported schemes they questioned not just fundamental frailties in drug testing controls but also the independence of antidoping authorities one year later similar basic questions about separation of power have taken on renewed relevance in american politics as result of russia breaches those questions have followed mr trump repeated attacks on the independence of the justice department in defiance of the post watergate norms intended to insulate law enforcement from partisan and personal agendas in the same way that mr trump has avoided acknowledging evidence of russia interference in the election thomas bach president of the international olympic committee took more than year to accept the extensive evidence of russia interference in the sochi olympic lab operations other sports officials such as the president of skiing governing body initially told me that the evidence on russia was conspiratorial or too hollywood just as some republican lawmakers have doubted the legitimacy of mr mueller mandate in drawing out his decision making until this week mr bach called for due process and stressed the importance of giving russia fair chance to defend itself one defense came just after the early penalties for russian athletes at the olympics set of cyberattacks group known as fancy bear which american intelligence officials tied to russia main military intelligence unit the published the hacked private medical records of top american athletes as well as the private emails of antidoping officials who had lobbied for ban on russia the hackers the same group that stole emails from the democratic national committee servers and released them ahead of the election called the athlete records proof of illegal drug use by stars such as simone biles and serena williams all athletes had received necessary clearances to use the substances in question and none of the information constituted violation in fiery interview in moscow last year mr mutko the former sports minister and current deputy prime minister echoed mr putin arguing that russia had been disadvantaged globally in sports as in all things he said the decks were stacked against the nation this week he was barred from attending any future olympics though he remains at the helm of russia soccer world cup somebody has to take the responsibility he said in

general manager of the philadelphia ers in the team was middling franchise whose city like most cities felt it had won fewer titles than it deserved one route to actually winning those titles seemed clear championships are won by teams with superstar and preferably two or three the most efficient way to secure such superstars is through the annual draft and the draft rules give an advantage to the teams with the worst records as hinkie took the reins fans quickly concluded that he was preparing to attempt novel strategy the sixers   tank deliberately fielding poor teams whose bottom of the league finishes   net them high draft picks this   take while to bring positive results but hinkie implored fans to ignore the team losses and look at the big picture we talk lot about process he said not outcome within couple of years this process had become the process and the phrase trust the process had become catechism for certain brand of fan joel embiid one of the first and biggest talents hinkie plan brought to philadelphia even adopted the nickname the process fans in philadelphia have been known to chant trust the process as he steps up to take free throws over time hinkie plan started to look as if it was working quite well perhaps too well last year full season after the polarizing hinkie submitted page letter of resignation the proposed new draft procedures that   make losing less attractive sports are defined by clear rules predictable mechanics and unambiguous results you really can devise workable system around them the same goes for game like blackjack in which your chances are consistent the dealer behavior is printed right on the table and everyone agrees on what makes good outcome the odds may be against you casinos are after all business but there really is an objectively correct way to play many hands even when you lose the process remains sound real life is not at all like blackjack and yet the same faith in process crops up in even the messiest realms late last year white   spokesman dismissed fears over robert mueller investigation by suggesting that the administration should be as sanguine as one of its lawyers take deep breath follow ty cobb lead trust the process anthony scaramucci during his abbreviated reign as white   communications director argued for health care system that   trust the process of the free market like in telecom

career in venture capital and got into buddhist podcast process can be soothing we defer to it almost out of habit as if it is machine that will resolve all conflicts so long as we can resist meddling with its workings but what if those workings and the conflicts behind them are precisely what we should be meddling with and arguing over the difference between process and any old series of events is that process is designed to lead to an outcome legal trial is in theory classic process two antagonists have their say under fair terms and agree to abide by the result one absurdity in kafka the trial is that the trial thing whose entire purpose is to produce an ending does not end the original german title is der process among the united states most cherished processes is the one enshrined in the fifth amendment and later the fourteenth no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the set of rights we ve come to think of as due process is process at its best offering whole litany of protections designed to minimize wrongful convictions presumption of innocence the right to an attorney the requirement that guilt be proved to an exceptionally high standard our generous conception of due process is source of national pride so much so that we some  come to expect it in every area of life for the past several months this has been the question raised as men are accused of sexual misbehavior or misconduct what kind of process might the accused be owed before suffering any consequences e ly if those consequences are as informal as having people generally despise you or demand your resignation from high profile job this is an open and debatable question and there are people in position to propose concrete answers to it and yet we ve often seen them call for process as way to avoid taking any clear position when white   adviser rob porter resigned amid reports of domestic abuse president trump tweeted is there no such thing any longer as due process but he was not to all appearances suggesting that porter be tried in court of law and if porter deserved some formal hearing before departing his job surely it was the trump administration itself that   have to provide it late last november as pressure built on representative john conyers to resign over accusations of sexual harassment the   minority leader nancy pelosi appeared on meet the press and maintained that we are strengthened by due process when asked how she might use her own powers to address the situation she   for instance have suspended him from his ranking position on the   judiciary committee she declined to give an answer invoking process lets us delegate our own judgments to some ostensibly neutral mechanism system that will formally decide things that might be difficult for us to decide ourselves but it can also absolve us of the responsibility to engage with the questions around us it can offer us cover for taking the positions we

thursday creditsaeed khan agence france presse getty imageswe all have our reasons for watching sports but at the forefront of mine is watching incredible athletes do incredible things they do things we cannot and it is magical want to see them thrive do not want to see them struggle for air thursday afternoon in melbourne at the australian open the french tennis player ga monfils in the middle of tense match against novak djokovic one of the greatest players of all time begged for help the surface temperature on the court registered at degrees celsius or degrees fahrenheit sick to the stomach monfils told the judges monfils one of the most athletic and fit players on the tour at the year first major wasn just hot he was scared tired and dizzy he went on he thought he had small heat stroke for minutes he staggered off the court between sets gasping going to collapse the response of the chair umpire in charge of the event was not here is some water or let take break or even good news ga this place has roof let close it it was instead reminder that players are allowed only second break between points so get back out there afterward djokovic who won the match but looked as haggard and sickly as monfils did said there is limit and that is level of guess tolerance between being fit and being think in danger in terms of health   was right at the limit when you watch two world class professionals barely able to lift their rackets in one of their sport signature events you can help but wonder what exactly we re trying to prove here reason we watch sports is to see the planet most talented dedicated athletes perform at the highest levels to see true physical genius in their chosen pursuits it is not to watch them perform at fraction of their abilities because they can hardly stand there has long been fetishization of athletes being able to withstand the elements to overcome them en route to victory the marathoner who survives degree temperatures the football player who braves frigid weather to win the big game but why to appreciate true genius is to see it uninhibited by exterior circumstances to see it in its purest natural element sports are entertainment and part of that entertainment is to see athletic genius at work why   we want to see wonderful athlete unable to be his or her best because it absurdly hot or cold outside the beauty is in the performance not what surrounds it   you appreciate say daniel day lewis performance more because it was done in storage freezer or in the middle of blazing desert never mind that knowing him he probably still win an oscar isn the art itself enough the has constructed whole cottage industry out of frozen tundra as spectacle all born from the infamous ice bowl of the championship game in which the packers outlasted the cowboys at lambeau field in conditions where the wind chill reached about minus degrees fahrenheit but that game is compelling only as lore in the moment it was virtually unwatchable and barely even resembled football during the game the packers quarterback bart starr got frostbite in his fingers the linebacker ray nitschke frostbite was so awful his toenails fell off the marching band in attendance  n play because the woodwinds froze after whistling for kickoff the referee norm schachter realized that his whistle was stuck to his lips when he tried to remove it the skin ripped from his mouth the refs stopped using their whistles after that and communicated by screaming for play to stop fan in the stands died this was not football this was simply bunch of men trying not to freeze to death and yet the game is still talked about as classic decades later to the detriment not just of the men and women who play but of the pleasure of the fans who watch them weather does not enhance the enjoyment of sports it stands in the way we watch sports to see great quarterback throw perfect pass to win the big game we do not watch the ball hit stiff wind and flutter like wounded duck   anyone want to watch basketball game where jump shots   be blown off course what   that tell us about who was the better team to watch the monfils djokovic match was to watch two men wilting and withering away neither looked like even close to the star tennis players we ve seen them both be for years closing the roof and providing climate controlled environment to play every sport in optimal conditions for athletes to thrive  n just be more humane to the players it   be far more enjoyable to watch we want to see athletes do incredible things that we cannot we do not want to see them

gymnastics at the london olympics at least one member of the team mckayla maroney has accused team doctor of sexually abusing her over period of years credit doug mills the   there were more names of course there were in gymnastics and in so many other sports swimming and judo and hockey and basketball there are always more girls more women more names this time the brave athlete stepping forward was mckayla maroney an olympic champion who posted twitter message on wednesday morning that was shocking yet sadly not so shocking at all was molested by dr larry nassar the team doctor for the us women national gymnastics team and olympic team maroney wrote adding her name to the growing list of gymnasts who have accused nassar of abusing them and to the growing list of women deciding to share their stories people should know that this is not just happening in hollywood maroney wrote reference to the harvey weinstein revelations that have become me too phenomenon on social media this is happening everywhere advertisement     the main   have my own me too stories many women do and to be crystal clear my experiences were very different from what maroney and the other gymnasts have described which includes accusations of serious crimes doctor molesting dozens of minors during his long career but distinguishing levels of harassment or abuse or rape is not the point of any of this the point is to stop this all of this     the main   advertisement     the main   so far more than women including athletes who competed at the highest levels of gymnastics have come forward to say that nassar had touched them inappropriately during medical appointments unlike weinstein nassar is in jail awaiting trial on multiple counts of criminal sexual conduct he already has pleaded guilty to child pornography charges he denies the many accusations of sexual assault and faces decades of prison time regardless of how many charges are leveled or how many lawsuits are filed we might never know how many young gymnasts have stories similar to the one maroney told on wednesday it sickens me to consider that there are probably many many more but now we know maroney was one of them and odds are she won be the last to raise her hand to say me too maroney said her abuse at the hands of nassar began when she was on tuesday the former soviet gymnast and olympic gold medalist tatiana gutsu also said me too gutsu did so on facebook accusing not doctor but an ex olympic teammate vitaly scherbo of raping her in when she was this is me being brave after years gutsu wrote she called scherbo monster who kept me in my own prison to be afraid for so many years   maroney won gold medal at the summer games in london years after she said team doctor abused his position to sexually assault her

none of this is new during congressional hearing about sexual abuse in sports in march rick adams the chief of paralympic sports for the united states olympic committee sat between two gymnasts and testified that the olympic community failed the people it supposed to protect those people who remained unprotected were athletes young ones older ones ones who have had to carry the burden of abuse for years their lips zipped and their hearts heavy ones whose parents had entrusted them to coaches adults who were supposed to keep those children safe ones who attended national gymnastics team

were unnecessary and disgusting the nassars and the weinsteins of the world who haven been outed yet should be worried about me too because now that women can see that they re not alone more will

capital and the making of millennials by malcolm harris pp little brown   when will someone stick up for millennials we have been sheltered by our parents swindled by our universities deadened by our therapists and for all this our reward has been glib condescension from the boomer press rising to our defense is harris our peer born as the book cover notes familiar provocateur from the internet left flank harris contends that america has stiffed our generation filling childhoods with homework and extracurricular activities all of this ostensibly served to prepare us for college and fruitful careers when really all it resulted in was the almost inevitable heartbreak of falling short of our parents expectations and ours harris spins recognizable   of hostile job market characterized by declines in worker solidarity and wages he uses the concept of human capital to analyze how much time millennials have invested in themselves by way of schoolwork and for what every authority from moms to presidents told millennials to accumulate as much human capital as we   and we did but the market hasn held up its end of the bargain he brings fresh contrarian eye to some of the usual data points he sees in the obama era nationalization of student debt not an aid to youngsters but goofy scheme to stimulate consumer demand for rising tuition costs at america public universities he blames greedy administrators rather than benighted state legislatures he argues that millennials deserved loot has been hoarded by the ownership class and seniors who have saved entitlement programs that serve them as steady government jobs disappear and the social safety net withers he also broadens his survey to cover school discipline and youtube stars and he makes surprising case that sexting isn as harmful as it cracked up to be advertisement     the main   as generational advocates go we   do worse than harris but he ends his book with fatalism nearly as flippant as the generational critiques he loathes despite this moment of political fellowship among millennials he writes off the possibility of meaningful change coming from government or social movements once we take over not optimistic myself no but what is our generation if not rich in skills we may yet put to good use     the main   advertisement     the main   the selfie generation how our self images are changing our notions of privacy sex consent and culture by alicia eler pp skyhorse   the social internet has been gripped in recent weeks by an app google arts and culture which relies on total trust from its users or perhaps their total lack of concern for privacy the app encourages users to take and upload selfies so that google facial recognition algorithm might compare them to its vast digital art archive google says it does not store the selfies one year ago our generation was donating to the now we re taking  s of ourselves for multinational corporation that has cooperated with the government surveillance programs such is the allure of the selfie eler who is the visual arts critic for the star tribune in minnesota and also millennial has published for years on the selfie and its implications for privacy self expression and sex in the selfie she finds an aspirational image essential to being seen by others online she sees the selfie as lifeline to those who struggle to be represented in the media ecosystem she mentions transpeople and agoraphobes and not all selfie takers she proves are as oblivious as imagined unfortunately eler book   have benefited from more careful edit her discursive style is some  whimsical but mostly distracting she dwells on topic having little to do with selfies and then glosses over complicated selfie related stories fake news in the election gets at least seven pages the macaque who took selfie and then saw peta sue for his copyright gets just two she provides an extended discussion of blogs that post screenshots of bad tinder conversations but glosses over the july facebook live stream by diamond reynolds after her husband philando castile was shot by the police and while there are moments where her light touch suits the material well section on social media surveillance at standing rock is hindered by her choice to discuss it through quoting meeting she had over coffee with protester in spite of its flaws though eler book alights on the source of the selfie power it is the easiest way to assert one humanity in our hyper networked world perhaps our much fussed over narcissism is not flaw but survival tactic igen why   super connected kids are growing up less rebellious more tolerant less happy and completely unprepared for adulthood by jean twenge pp atria   back in the psychologist twenge swiped at millennials in her book generation me she wrote then that we were miserable entitled narcissists ruined by our parents adoration she was trying to rebut neil howe and the late william strauss the gurus of generational theory who had contended in that civic oriented millennials   become the next great generation time has evidently softened her advertisement     the main   her new igen pities rather than disdains those born after arguing that smartphone addiction has saddled new generation with profound psychological problems including sleep deprivation depression and unshakable senses of loneliness and fear they drink less and have less sex they socialize less without their parents present they hardly read for pleasure or go to the mall they eschew church and even spirituality they kill themselves more but others less they wait longer to get drivers licenses and give birth twenge premises her conclusions on longitudinal studies of high schoolers and college students which she supplements with first person accounts from members of igen she concludes by offering this advice do not sleep with it or give it nude pictures of yourself it is not your lover do not continuously turn your attention to it when you are talking with someone in person it is not your best friend twenge is right to highlight smartphones contributions to our malaise in one section she notes the feeling of rejection that arises from text sent without an immediate response and in another she notes that more screen time leads to less in person socializing which breeds loneliness she   stand to incorporate some of harris alarm about the economy she duly recognizes income inequality as prime source of igen anxiety about its future but while she discusses how smartphones do their harm she has no such harsh words for the modern labor market instead she tells marketers how to exploit igen diminished expectations which struck me as tacky and not particularly useful besides the kids may spend

advertisementsupported byfirst wordsis it better to trust the process or to change it imagecreditillustration by derek brahneyby marc tracymarch when year old named sam hinkie became president and general manager of the philadelphia ers in the team was middling franchise whose city like most cities felt it had won fewer titles than it deserved one route to actually winning those titles seemed clear championships are won by teams with superstar and preferably two or three the most efficient way to secure such superstars is through the annual draft and the draft rules give an advantage to the teams with the worst records as hinkie took the reins fans quickly concluded that he was preparing to attempt novel strategy the sixers   tank deliberately fielding poor teams whose bottom of the league finishes   net them high draft picks this   take while to bring positive results but hinkie implored fans to ignore the team losses and look at the big picture we talk lot about process he said not outcome within couple of years this process had become the process and the phrase trust the process had become catechism for certain brand of fan joel embiid one of the first and biggest talents hinkie plan brought to philadelphia even adopted the nickname the process fans in philadelphia have been known to chant trust the process as he steps up to take free throws over time hinkie plan started to look as if it was working quite well perhaps too well last year full season after the polarizing hinkie submitted page letter of resignation the proposed new draft procedures that   make losing less attractive sports are defined by clear rules predictable mechanics and unambiguous results you really can devise workable system around them the same goes for game like blackjack in which your chances are consistent the dealer behavior is printed right on the table and everyone agrees on what makes good outcome the odds may be against you casinos are after all business but there really is an objectively correct way to play many hands even when you lose the process remains sound real life is not at all like blackjack and yet the same faith in process crops up in even the messiest realms late last year white   spokesman dismissed fears over robert mueller investigation by suggesting that the administration should be as sanguine as one of its lawyers take deep breath follow ty cobb lead trust the process anthony scaramucci during his abbreviated reign as white   communications director argued for health care system that   trust the process of the free market like in telecom

career in venture capital and got into buddhist podcast process can be soothing we defer to it almost out of habit as if it is machine that will resolve all conflicts so long as we can resist meddling with its workings but what if those workings and the conflicts behind them are precisely what we should be meddling with and arguing over the difference between process and any old series of events is that process is designed to lead to an outcome legal trial is in theory classic process two antagonists have their say under fair terms and agree to abide by the result one absurdity in kafka the trial is that the trial thing whose entire purpose is to produce an ending does not end the original german title is der process among the united states most cherished processes is the one enshrined in the fifth amendment and later the fourteenth no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the set of rights we ve come to think of as due process is process at its best offering whole litany of protections designed to minimize wrongful convictions presumption of innocence the right to an attorney the requirement that guilt be proved to an exceptionally high standard our generous conception of due process is source of national pride so much so that we some  come to expect it in every area of life for the past several months this has been the question raised as men are accused of sexual misbehavior or misconduct what kind of process might the accused be owed before suffering any consequences e ly if those consequences are as informal as having people generally despise you or demand your resignation from high profile job this is an open and debatable question and there are people in position to propose concrete answers to it and yet we ve often seen them call for process as way to avoid taking any clear position when white   adviser rob porter resigned amid reports of domestic abuse president trump tweeted is there no such thing any longer as due process but he was not to all appearances suggesting that porter be tried in court of law and if porter deserved some formal hearing before departing his job surely it was the trump administration itself that   have to provide it late last november as pressure built on representative john conyers to resign over accusations of sexual harassment the   minority leader nancy pelosi appeared on meet the press and maintained that we are strengthened by due process when asked how she might use her own powers to address the situation she   for instance have suspended him from his ranking position on the   judiciary committee she declined to give an answer invoking process lets us delegate our own judgments to some ostensibly neutral mechanism system that will formally decide things that might be difficult for us to decide ourselves but it can also absolve us of the responsibility to engage with the questions around us it can offer us cover for taking the positions we wanted to all along columbia university for instance has declined to negotiate with union formed by its graduate students even after that union was approved by the national labor relations board and voted on by the students themselves stance that will push the matter into further litigation we have declined to bargain the university provost said in january until the legal process has been allowed to run its course this is one kind of language process can speak sorry it seems to say our hands are tied we re forced to let this play out in precisely the way we already preferred in as the police

told us to trust the political process but process is not magical ritual it is designed to accomplish something specific and if it fails it can be redesigned of the constitutional amendments ratified since the bill of rights have changed the rules of voting and representation and after humphrey was defeated by richard nixon the democrats found themselves revisiting their primary system commission led by donald fraser and george mcgovern peacenik senator from south dakota proposed changes to the primaries that   transfer power from party bosses to the rank and file three presidential elections later after the candidates this new system encouraged including mcgovern failed to thrive democrats changed the rules again swinging authority back to party loyalists with the creation of superdelegates in those superdelegates came to seem to supporters of an insurgent bernie sanders like an emblem of the party establishment preference for the presumptive nominee hillary clinton at the party convention the democratic national committee created another commission to examine voting processes it issued its recommendations late in including measures like drastically reducing the number of superdelegates and opening caucuses to absentee participation many in the party have joined in support of these changes no less than tim kaine clinton handpicked running mate tweeted early this month we democrats need to do away with superdelegates once and for all they are given undue influence and make the presidential nominating process less democratic but even explaining those

advertisementsupported bynews analysiswhy russia tried to cheat its way to gloryimagepresident vladimir putin with russian athletes at the winter olympics in sochi creditmikhail klimentyev agence france presse getty imagesby rebecca ruizdec lausanne switzerland what do you think about your new president you are shocked the man posing the question to me was mikhail kusnirovich owner of russia largest department store he and donald trump had tried to strike deal to bring the miss universe pageant to red square years before he said he went on to answer his own question think he going to be good it was december in mr kusnirovich office overlooking the kremlin weeks before united states intelligence agencies   publicly conclude that russia had interfered in the election in the interest of tilting it toward mr trump nesting dolls with the american president elect face stared out of stalls at the holiday markets but the topic at hand for me was not election meddling but rather russia sophisticated cheating at the winter olympics in sochi russia two subversions of global sports and american democracy have more in common than you may think both involve intelligence agents russia will to win and the same cyberespionage team both have prompted millions of dollars of investigations and challenged public confidence in the purity of sport and in the strength of democracy the two breaches are at the heart of how president vladimir putin has suggested he wants to reclaim russia past by weakening western democracy and dominating world sports mr kusnirovich belonged to group of prominent public figures focused on restoring russian sports to good global standing the group was created last summer by mr putin after revelations that the nation had stolen medals in sochi by relying on steroid laced martinis hundreds of ounces of stockpiled clean urine and the overnight stealth of the country federal security service the kremlin dismissed the details of both schemes as absurd but on tuesday russia was barred from the winter games for its state backed cheating some individual russian athletes may compete independently in neutral uniforms but the russian flag will not appear when the games begin in pyeongchang south korea the details of the sports scandal deconstructed by russian whistle blowers who have provided rare insider insights offer perhaps the purest case study of russia drive to dominate its brazen methods and in part its motivation to influence the american presidency in declassified intelligence report released early this year united states officials said russia attacks on the election had been for mr putin partial payback for the doping scandal which he repeatedly called an american led effort to defame russia last month as new medals were stripped from russian olympians mr putin said the disqualifications were the united states attempt to undermine his re election in fact sports regulators and investigators who conducted the multiple investigations into russia doping are headquartered in canada and the olympic leadership in charge of disqualifying athletes is based in switzerland it was the former president of that staunchly neutral country samuel schmid who conducted the latest investigation for the olympic committee resulting in tuesday sanctions in scrutinizing russia sports and antidoping officials have said they acted on objective forensic and scientific evidence of russia fraud documents data lab analyses and glass bottles of urine with telltale signs of tampering just as allies of the   counsel robert mueller have done this year in the context of the election inquiry the officials have defended their impartiality and interest in plain facts three key whistle blowers helped provide those facts grigory rodchenkov russia former longtime chief antidoping chemist as well as yuliya and vitaly stepanov former russian runner and former employee of the nation antidoping agency all now live in the united states in undisclosed locations from which they have spoken openly about years of coordinated cheating the justice department too has taken interest in their evidence dr rodchenkov whose personal diaries cataloged each day of cheating in sochi came to the united states only after vitaly mutko russia deputy prime minister and former sports minister asked him to resign in light of growing global suspicions about the extent of the nation cheating which the chemist had helped mastermind   we also have meeting how to come from defensive to offensive dr rodchenkov wrote to me in an email on nov having initially denied wrongdoing in our early exchanges at that meeting mr mutko effectively dismissed him and set off dramatic chain of events freedom he wrote in another email that night dr rodchenkov tell all account reported in the   in may and detailed in the documentary icarus culminated in russia olympic ban this week it was instrumental in motivating some russian officials to temper their rigid denials and acknowledge that an institutional conspiracy had existed though they maintained it had not been state sponsored still before this week final sanctions were announced global athletes antidoping advocates and some sponsors had expressed concern about growing crisis in international sports pointing to the long delay by both regulators and olympic officials in responding to evidence of widespread cheating that went even beyond sochi as those critics wondered when or if sports officials   penalize russia for its systematic transgressions by rescinding olympic medals and condemning the state supported schemes they questioned not just fundamental frailties in drug testing controls but also the independence of antidoping authorities one year later similar basic questions about separation of power have taken on renewed relevance in american politics as result of russia breaches those questions have followed mr trump repeated attacks on the independence of the justice department in defiance of the post watergate norms intended to insulate law enforcement from partisan and personal agendas in the same way that mr trump has avoided acknowledging evidence of russia interference in the election thomas bach president of the international olympic committee took more than year to accept the extensive evidence of russia interference in the sochi olympic lab operations other sports officials such as the president of skiing governing body initially told me that the evidence on russia was conspiratorial or too hollywood just as some republican lawmakers have doubted the legitimacy of mr mueller mandate in drawing out his decision making until this week mr bach called for due process and stressed the importance of giving russia fair chance to defend itself one defense came just after the early penalties for russian athletes at the olympics set of cyberattacks group known as fancy bear which american intelligence officials tied to russia main military intelligence unit the published the hacked private medical records of top american athletes as well as the private emails of antidoping officials who had lobbied for ban on russia the hackers the same group that stole emails from the democratic national committee servers and released them ahead of the election called the athlete records proof of illegal drug use by stars such as simone biles and serena williams all athletes had received necessary clearances to use the substances in question and none of the information constituted violation in fiery interview in moscow last year mr mutko the former sports minister and current deputy prime minister echoed mr putin arguing that russia had been disadvantaged globally in sports as in all things he said the decks were stacked against the nation this week he was barred from attending any future olympics though he remains at the helm of russia soccer world cup somebody has to take the responsibility he said in

advertisementsupported byq tell us things about your book inside the fevered minds of sports fansby john williamsfeb imagecreditpatricia wall the  if you ve never had your heart broken or your nerves thoroughly frayed by sporting event you know someone who has as young journalist at the los angeles   in the george dohrmann   field late night phone calls from rabid fans he wondered being fan himself why the depth of their devotion mystified him my blindness to the root causes of their thinking and conduct was also ignorance about myself he writes in his new book superfans into the heart of obsessive sports fandom dohrmann who spent time as an investigative reporter at sports illustrated and is now senior editor at the athletic spoke to everyday fans academics and scientists about what it is that drives our vicarious competitive mania below he talks about whether kids should be fans his admiration for the soccer player clint dempsey and more when did you first get the idea to write this book it long been curiosity of mine why people were so intense about their favorite team certainly had my favorites throughout my life as young person it was notre dame football and growing up in california the giants in baseball and the warriors in basketball most of those teams fell away but what became my one true obsession was the united states men national soccer team but never on the level that   see from people both as young journalist and then later when was doing investigative journalism on colleges getting death threats from fans who were upset what is it that makes people this passionate love sports too but how did they get there then had kids have an eight year old and five year old and started asking myself about fandom and how to introduce it to them it all came together three or four years ago it felt like the moment professionally and personally for me to dive into this book there are so many books that explore someone individual fandom but those aren that accessible if not red sox fan not going to read book about red sox fan thought if you wrote something that introduced different people from around the country that was more approachable way to analyze fandom what the most surprising thing you learned while writing it imagegeorge dohrmanncreditadam moorei talked to susan harter renowned child psychologist about how kids receive their parents fandom she told me that we shouldn be introducing our kids to fandom until adolescence this runs contrary to what we do we put baby in green bay packers onesie this is what we see all the time and we celebrate it posting pictures of it and saying how cute it is but kid wrote about an eagles fan was just melting down in youtube videos while the patriots were beating his team harter said kids want to see the world in black and white they want to divide the world into good and bad and sports does that but the kids don understand that the fact that their teacher is an auburn fan doesn make them bad person they don understand that daddy going to be when his team loses they lack perspective they can say well it been good season even though we lost this game some  now watch game outside the home so my kids don see me yelling at the tv and see that it important to me don want them to make it important right now in what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write initially wanted to have more fan athlete engagement in the book more opportunities for athletes to confront the fans who often say critical things about them thought that   make for good   and did reach out to some athletes but ultimately concluded that part of fandom blazing is what they call it that troll behavior while it exists it felt like falling into trap just looking at the worst of fans there is some bad behavior in the book but it felt too voyeuristic to keep highlighting these really extreme negative fans who is creative person not writer who has influenced you and your work for long time my favorite national team player was clint dempsey liked him because he was successful but loved how he was successful and why loved that he grew up poor and had to go outside the traditional soccer development system he wasn put on the conveyor belt to greatness that inspiring someone who works outside the system and still gets to the top of it he   take risks on the field it was like he was saying going to try for greatness and might look foolish some  and it might not work out but going to shoot for greatness here that was something to love and admire about him and something that anyone can bring into their own work we have to take shots here persuade someone to read superfans in words or less lot of people wonder about sports fans behavior they might be

answer his own question think he going to be good it was december in mr kusnirovich office overlooking the kremlin weeks before united states intelligence agencies   publicly conclude that russia had interfered in the election in the interest of tilting it toward mr trump nesting dolls with the american president elect face stared out of stalls at the holiday markets but the topic at hand for me was not election meddling but rather russia sophisticated cheating at the winter olympics in sochi russia two subversions of global sports and american democracy have more in common than you may think both involve intelligence agents russia will to win and the same cyberespionage team both have prompted millions of dollars of investigations and challenged public confidence in the purity of sport and in the strength of democracy the two breaches are at the heart of how president vladimir putin has suggested he wants to reclaim russia past by weakening western democracy and dominating world sports advertisement     the main   mr kusnirovich belonged to group of prominent public figures focused on restoring russian sports to good global standing the group was created last summer by mr

scandal deconstructed by russian whistle blowers who have provided rare insider insights offer perhaps the purest case study of russia drive to dominate its brazen methods and in part its motivation to influence the american presidency in declassified intelligence report released early this year united states officials said russia attacks on the election had been for mr putin partial payback for the doping scandal which he repeatedly called an american led effort to defame russia last month as new medals were stripped from russian olympians mr putin said the disqualifications were the united states attempt to undermine his re election in fact sports regulators and investigators who conducted the multiple investigations into russia doping are headquartered in canada and the olympic leadership in charge of disqualifying athletes is based in switzerland it was the former president of that staunchly neutral country samuel schmid who conducted the latest investigation for the olympic committee resulting in tuesday sanctions in scrutinizing russia sports and antidoping officials have said they acted on objective forensic and scientific evidence of russia fraud documents data lab analyses and glass bottles of urine with telltale signs of tampering just as allies of the   counsel robert mueller have done this year in the context of the election inquiry the officials

some russian officials to temper their rigid denials and acknowledge that an institutional conspiracy had existed though they maintained it had not been state sponsored still before this week final sanctions were announced global athletes antidoping advocates and some sponsors had expressed concern about growing crisis in international sports pointing to the long delay by both regulators and olympic officials in responding to evidence of widespread cheating that went even beyond sochi as those critics wondered when or if sports officials   penalize russia for its systematic transgressions by rescinding olympic medals and condemning the state supported schemes they questioned not just fundamental frailties in drug testing controls but also the independence of antidoping authorities one year later similar basic questions about separation of power have taken on renewed relevance in american politics as result of russia breaches those questions have followed mr trump repeated attacks on the independence of the justice department in defiance of the post watergate norms intended to insulate law enforcement from partisan and personal agendas in the same way that mr trump has avoided acknowledging evidence of russia interference in the election thomas bach president of the international olympic committee took more than year to accept the extensive evidence of russia interference in the sochi olympic lab operations other sports officials such as the president of skiing governing body initially told me that the evidence on russia was conspiratorial or too hollywood just as some republican lawmakers have doubted the legitimacy of mr mueller mandate in drawing out his decision making until this week mr bach called for due process and stressed the importance of giving russia

capital and the making of millennials by malcolm harris pp little brown   when will someone stick up for millennials we have been sheltered by our parents swindled by our universities deadened by our therapists and for all this our reward has been glib condescension from the boomer press rising to our defense is harris our peer born as the book cover notes familiar provocateur from the internet left flank harris contends that america has stiffed our generation filling childhoods with homework and extracurricular activities all of this ostensibly served to prepare us for college and fruitful careers when really all it resulted in was the almost inevitable heartbreak of falling short of our parents expectations and ours harris spins recognizable   of hostile job market characterized by declines in worker solidarity and wages he uses the concept of human capital to analyze how much time millennials have invested in themselves by way of schoolwork and for what every authority from moms to presidents told millennials to accumulate as much human capital as we   and we did but the market hasn held up its end of the bargain he brings fresh contrarian eye to some of the usual data points he sees in the obama era nationalization of student debt not an aid to youngsters but goofy scheme to stimulate consumer demand for rising tuition costs at america public universities he blames greedy administrators rather than benighted state legislatures he argues that millennials deserved loot has been hoarded by the ownership class and seniors who have saved entitlement programs that serve them as steady government jobs disappear and the social safety net withers he also broadens his survey to cover school discipline and youtube stars and he makes surprising case that sexting isn as harmful as it cracked up to be advertisement     the main   as generational advocates go we   do worse than harris but he ends his book with fatalism nearly as flippant as the generational critiques he loathes despite this moment of political fellowship among millennials he writes off the possibility of meaningful change coming from government or social movements once we take over not optimistic myself no but what is our generation if not rich in skills we may yet put to good use     the main   advertisement     the main   the selfie generation how our self images are changing our notions of privacy sex consent and culture by alicia eler pp skyhorse   the social internet has been gripped in recent weeks by an app google arts and culture which relies on total trust from its users or perhaps their total lack of concern for privacy the app encourages users to take and upload selfies so that google facial recognition algorithm might compare them to its vast digital art archive google says it does not store the selfies one year ago our generation was donating to the now we re taking  s of ourselves for multinational corporation that has cooperated with the government surveillance programs such is the allure of the selfie eler who is the visual arts critic for the star tribune in minnesota and also millennial has published for years on the selfie and its implications for privacy self expression and sex in the selfie she finds an aspirational image essential to being seen by others online she sees the selfie as lifeline to those who struggle to be represented in the media ecosystem she mentions transpeople and agoraphobes and not all selfie takers she proves are as oblivious as imagined unfortunately eler book   have benefited from more careful edit her discursive style is some  whimsical but mostly distracting she dwells on topic having little to do with selfies and then glosses over complicated selfie related stories fake news in the election gets at least seven pages the macaque who took selfie and then saw peta sue for his copyright gets just two she provides an extended discussion of blogs that post screenshots of bad tinder conversations but glosses over the july facebook live stream by diamond reynolds after her husband philando castile was shot by the police and while there are moments where her light touch suits the material well section on social media surveillance at standing rock is hindered by her choice to discuss it through quoting meeting she had over coffee with protester in spite of its flaws though eler book alights on the source of the selfie power it is the easiest way to assert one humanity in our hyper networked world perhaps our much fussed over narcissism is not flaw but survival tactic igen why   super connected kids are growing up less rebellious more tolerant less happy and completely unprepared for adulthood by jean twenge pp atria   back in the psychologist twenge swiped at millennials in her book generation me she wrote then that we were miserable entitled narcissists ruined by our parents adoration she was trying to rebut neil howe and the late william strauss the gurus of generational theory who had contended in that civic oriented millennials   become the next great generation time has evidently softened her advertisement     the main   her new igen pities rather than disdains those born after arguing that smartphone addiction has saddled new generation with profound psychological problems including sleep deprivation depression and unshakable senses of loneliness and fear they drink less and have less sex they socialize less without their parents present they hardly read for pleasure or go to the mall they eschew church and even spirituality they kill themselves more but others less they wait longer to get drivers licenses and give birth twenge premises her conclusions on longitudinal studies of high schoolers and college students which she supplements with first person accounts from members of igen she concludes by offering this advice do not sleep with it or give it nude pictures of yourself it is not your lover do not continuously turn your attention to it when you are talking with someone in person it is not your best friend twenge is right to highlight smartphones contributions to our malaise in one section she notes the feeling of rejection that arises from text sent without an immediate response and in another she notes that more screen time leads to less in person socializing which breeds loneliness she   stand to incorporate some of harris alarm about the economy she duly recognizes income inequality as prime source of igen anxiety about its future but while she discusses how smartphones do their harm she has no such harsh words for the modern labor market instead she tells marketers how to exploit igen diminished expectations which struck me as tacky and not particularly useful besides the kids may spend

thursday creditsaeed khan agence france presse getty imageswe all have our reasons for watching sports but at the forefront of mine is watching incredible athletes do incredible things they do things we cannot and it is magical want to see them thrive do not want to see them struggle for air thursday afternoon in melbourne at the australian open the french tennis player ga monfils in the middle of tense match against novak djokovic one of the greatest players of all time begged for help the surface temperature on the court registered at degrees celsius or degrees fahrenheit sick to the stomach monfils told the judges monfils one of the most athletic and fit players on the tour at the year first major wasn just hot he was scared tired and dizzy he went on he thought he had small heat stroke for minutes he staggered off the court between sets gasping going to collapse the response of the chair umpire in charge of the event was not here is some water or let take break or even good news ga this place has roof let close it it was instead reminder that players are allowed only second break between points so get back out there afterward djokovic who won the match but looked as haggard and sickly as monfils did said there is limit and that is level of guess tolerance between being fit and being think in danger in terms of health   was right at the limit when you watch two world class professionals barely able to lift their rackets in one of their sport signature events you can help but wonder what exactly we re trying to prove here reason we watch sports is to see the planet most talented dedicated athletes perform at the highest levels to see true physical genius in their chosen pursuits it is not to watch them perform at fraction of their abilities because they can hardly stand there has long been fetishization of athletes being able to withstand the elements to overcome them en route to victory the marathoner who survives degree temperatures the football player who braves frigid weather to win the big game but why to appreciate true genius is to see it uninhibited by exterior circumstances to see it in its purest natural element sports are entertainment and part of that entertainment is to see athletic genius at work why   we want to see wonderful athlete unable to be his or her best because it absurdly hot or cold outside the beauty is in the performance not what surrounds it   you appreciate say daniel day lewis performance more because it was done in storage freezer or in the middle of blazing desert never mind that knowing him he probably still win an oscar isn the art itself enough the has constructed whole cottage industry out of frozen tundra as spectacle all born from the infamous ice bowl of the championship game in which the packers outlasted the cowboys at lambeau field in conditions where the wind chill reached about minus degrees fahrenheit but that game is compelling only as lore in the moment it was virtually unwatchable and barely even resembled football during the game the packers quarterback bart starr got frostbite in his fingers the linebacker ray nitschke frostbite was so awful his toenails fell off the marching band in attendance  n play because the woodwinds froze after whistling for kickoff the referee norm schachter realized that his whistle was stuck to his lips when he tried to remove it the skin ripped from his mouth the refs stopped using their whistles after that and communicated by screaming for play to stop fan in the stands died this was not football this was simply bunch of men trying not to freeze to death and yet the game is still talked about as classic decades later to the detriment not just of the men and women who play but of the pleasure of the fans who watch them weather does not enhance the enjoyment of sports it stands in the way we watch sports to see great quarterback throw perfect pass to win the big game we do not watch the ball hit stiff wind and flutter like wounded duck   anyone want to watch basketball game where jump shots   be blown off course what   that tell us about who was the better team to watch the monfils djokovic match was to watch two men wilting and withering away neither looked like even close to the star tennis players we ve seen them both be for years closing the roof and providing climate controlled environment to play every sport in optimal conditions for athletes to thrive  n just be more humane to the players it   be far more enjoyable to watch we want to see athletes do incredible things that we cannot we do not want to see them

supported by magazine is it better to trust the process or to change it first words by marc tracy march     the main   share this page     the main     credit illustration by derek brahney when year old named sam hinkie became president and general manager of the philadelphia ers in the team was middling franchise whose city like most cities felt it had won fewer titles than it deserved one route to actually winning those titles seemed clear championships are won by teams with superstar and preferably two or three the most efficient way to secure such superstars is through the annual draft and the draft rules give an advantage to the teams with the worst records as hinkie took the reins fans quickly concluded that he was preparing to attempt novel strategy the sixers   tank deliberately fielding poor teams whose bottom of the league finishes   net them high draft picks this   take while to bring positive results but hinkie implored fans to ignore the team losses and look at the big picture we talk lot about process he said not outcome within couple of years this process had become the process and the phrase trust the process had become catechism for certain brand of fan joel embiid one of the first and biggest talents hinkie plan brought to philadelphia even adopted the nickname the process fans in philadelphia have been known to chant trust the process as he steps up to take free throws over time hinkie plan started to look as if it was working quite well perhaps too well last year full season after the polarizing hinkie submitted page letter of resignation the proposed new draft procedures that   make losing less attractive sports are defined by clear rules predictable mechanics and unambiguous results you really can devise workable system around them the same goes for game like blackjack in which your chances are consistent the dealer behavior is printed right on the table and everyone agrees on what makes good outcome the odds may be against you casinos are after all business but there really is an objectively correct way to play many hands even when you lose the process remains sound real life is not at all like blackjack and yet the same faith in process crops up in even the messiest realms late last year white   spokesman dismissed fears over robert mueller investigation by suggesting that the administration should be as sanguine as one of its lawyers take deep breath follow ty cobb lead trust the process anthony scaramucci during his abbreviated reign as white   communications director argued for health care system that   trust

mantra while taking an improv class he left his career in venture capital and got into buddhist podcast     the main   advertisement     the main   process can be soothing we defer to it almost out of habit as if it is machine that will resolve all conflicts so long as we can resist meddling with its workings but what if those workings and the conflicts behind them are precisely what we should be meddling with and arguing over the difference between process and any old series of events is that process is designed to lead to an outcome legal trial is in theory classic process two antagonists have their say under fair terms and agree to abide by the result one absurdity in kafka the trial is that the trial thing whose entire purpose is to produce an ending does not end the original german title is der process among the united states most cherished processes is the one enshrined in the fifth amendment and later the fourteenth no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the set of rights we ve come to think of as due process is process at its best offering whole litany of protections designed to minimize wrongful convictions presumption of innocence the right to an attorney the requirement that guilt be proved to an exceptionally high standard our generous conception of due process is source of national pride so much so that we some  come to expect it in every area of life advertisement     the main   for the past several months this has been the question raised as men are accused of sexual misbehavior or misconduct what kind of process might the accused be owed before suffering any consequences e ly if those consequences are as informal as having people generally despise you or demand your resignation from high profile job this is an open and debatable question and there are people in position to propose concrete answers to it and yet we ve often seen them call for process as way to avoid taking any clear position when white   adviser rob porter resigned amid reports of domestic abuse president trump tweeted is there no such thing any longer as due process but he was not to all appearances suggesting that porter be

supported by magazine is it better to trust the process or to change it first words by marc tracy march     the main   share this page     the main     credit illustration by derek brahney when year old named sam hinkie became president and general manager of the philadelphia ers in the team was middling franchise whose city like most cities felt it had won fewer titles than it deserved one route to actually winning those titles seemed clear championships are won by teams with superstar and preferably two or three the most efficient way to secure such superstars is through the annual draft and the draft rules give an advantage to the teams with the worst records as hinkie took the reins fans quickly concluded that he was preparing to attempt novel strategy the sixers   tank deliberately fielding poor teams whose bottom of the league finishes   net them high draft picks this   take while to bring positive results but hinkie implored fans to ignore the team losses and look at the big picture we talk lot about process he said not outcome within couple of years this process had become the process and the phrase trust the process had become catechism for certain brand of fan joel embiid one of the first and biggest talents hinkie plan brought to philadelphia even adopted the nickname the process fans in philadelphia have been known to chant trust the process as he steps up to take free throws over time hinkie plan started to look as if it was working quite well perhaps too well last year full season after the polarizing hinkie submitted page letter of resignation the proposed new draft procedures that   make losing less attractive sports are defined by clear rules predictable mechanics and unambiguous results you really can devise workable system around them the same goes for game like blackjack in which your chances are consistent the dealer behavior is printed right on the table and everyone agrees on what makes good outcome the odds may be against you casinos are after all business but there really is an objectively correct way to play many hands even when you lose the process remains sound real life is not at all like blackjack and yet the same faith in process crops up in even the messiest realms late last year white   spokesman dismissed fears over robert mueller investigation by suggesting that the administration should be as sanguine as one of its lawyers take deep breath follow ty cobb lead trust the process anthony scaramucci during his abbreviated reign as white   communications director argued for health care system that   trust

habit as if it is machine that will resolve all conflicts so long as we can resist meddling with its workings but what if those workings and the conflicts behind them are precisely what we should be meddling with and arguing over the difference between process and any old series of events is that process is designed to lead to an outcome legal trial is in theory classic process two antagonists have their say under fair terms and agree to abide by the result one absurdity in kafka the trial is that the trial thing whose entire purpose is to produce an ending does not end the original german title is der process among the united states most cherished processes is the one enshrined in the fifth amendment and later the fourteenth no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the set of rights we ve come to think of as due process is process at its best offering whole litany of protections designed to minimize wrongful convictions presumption of innocence the right to an attorney the requirement that guilt be proved to an exceptionally high standard our generous conception of due process is source of national pride so much so that we some  come to expect it in every area of life advertisement     the main   for the past several months this has been the question raised as men are accused of sexual misbehavior or misconduct what kind of process might the accused be owed before suffering any consequences e ly if those consequences are as informal as having people generally despise you or demand your resignation from high profile job this is an open and debatable question and there are people in position to propose concrete answers to it and yet we ve often seen them call for process as way to avoid taking any clear position when white   adviser rob porter resigned amid reports of domestic abuse president trump tweeted is there no such thing any longer as due process but he was not to all appearances suggesting that porter be

course there were in gymnastics and in so many other sports swimming and judo and hockey and basketball there are always more girls more women more names this time the brave athlete stepping forward was mckayla maroney an olympic champion who posted twitter message on wednesday morning that was shocking yet sadly not so shocking at all was molested by dr larry nassar the team doctor for the us women national gymnastics team and olympic team maroney wrote adding her name to the growing list of gymnasts who have accused nassar of abusing them and to the growing list of women deciding to share their stories people should know that this is not just happening in hollywood maroney wrote reference to the harvey weinstein revelations that have become me too phenomenon on social media this is happening everywhere advertisement     the main   have my own me too stories many women do and to be crystal clear my experiences were very different from what maroney and the other gymnasts have described which includes accusations of serious crimes doctor molesting dozens of minors during his long career but distinguishing levels of harassment or abuse or rape is not the point of any of this the point is to stop this all of this     the main   advertisement     the main   so far more than women including athletes who competed at the highest levels of gymnastics have come forward to say

to child pornography charges he denies the many accusations of sexual assault and faces decades of prison time regardless of how many charges are leveled or how many lawsuits are filed we might never know how many young gymnasts have stories similar to the one maroney told on wednesday it sickens me to consider that there are probably many many more but now we know maroney was one of them and odds are she won be the last to raise her hand to say me too maroney said her abuse at the hands of nassar began when she was on tuesday the former soviet gymnast and olympic gold medalist tatiana gutsu also said me too gutsu did so on facebook accusing not doctor but an ex olympic teammate vitaly scherbo of raping her in when she was this is me being brave after years gutsu wrote she called scherbo

were unnecessary and disgusting the nassars and the weinsteins of the world who haven been outed yet should be worried about me too because now that women can see that they re not alone more will speak up because so many of them have stories to tell like me there was the time when covered nascar in the and was cornered by top driver in the back of his trailer while trying to conduct an

kept putting his hand on my leg as sat next to him during group interview or the meeting at the olympics where man in public relations threw himself at me hands grabbing as soon as he closed his office door forcing me to talk my way out of the room thought all of those experiences were just par for the course for woman in sports and in many ways it turns out they were but those moments were

advertisementsupported bynews analysisthe college sports tax dodgeimagecreditmarta monteiroby mike mcintiredec new york university does not have much of an athletic program but years ago it ran profitable macaroni company leading indirectly to decision by congress that college sports if not college owned noodle business should be exempt from taxation   as the hugely lucrative football bowl season wraps up colleges fear that the new tax law signed by president trump   derail their gravy train two provisions target coaches high salaries and booster donations tied to ticket purchases but they need not worry much there are no plans to start taxing television revenue and corporate sponsorships two of the biggest income streams which together transformed intercollegiate athletics into multibillion dollar business even with the legislative changes collegiate sports remain largely tax exempt the beneficiary of public subsidy that is increasingly difficult to defend the corrosive culture of money in big time college sports more than billion year among the national collegiate athletic association division sports programs was painfully obvious recently with the indictments of college coaches and an adidas executive charged with paying bribes to recruit basketball players and steer them to agents it was left to federal prosecutors to issue statement condemning the criminal influence of money on coaches and student athletes the tax exempt nature of college sports is not the cause of these problems rather it is rocket fuel for an engine that has escaped the gravitational pull of common sense and decency to understand how this is possible consider the balance sheet of the atlantic coast conference home of the national champions in football clemson and men basketball north carolina its corporate sponsors include toyota gatorade and geico when the conference filed its annual tax return for it reported about quarter billion dollars from broadcasting games for its member universities as well as million in other sports related revenue its commissioner earned million the was huge commercial success with income that   normally generate huge tax bill but no taxes were owed as the conference explained in its filing with the internal revenue service the atlantic coast and its member schools are nonprofit charitable organizations that place an emphasis on academic excellence the atlantic coast conference it said seeks to maximize the educational and athletic opportunities of its student athletes while enriching their quality of life the magic word here is educational student athletes have always been considered unpaid amateurs engaging in extracurricular activities rather than profitable professions so college sports is deemed part of the educational mission of schools and exempt from income taxes there are specific and contentious interpretations of law that prop up this assumption in the modern era but they have weakened as big time college sports has taken on the trappings of profit driven business far removed from the cloistered groves of academe it is only through decades of aggressive lobbying and legal battles that universities have managed to avoid income taxes on billions of dollars from broadcast rights sponsorships and donations from boosters the seminal moment came in response to an attempt by to extend its tax exempt status to profits generated by mueller company pasta maker that had been donated to its law school in congress took notice and eventually enacted the unrelated business income tax to capture revenue considered ancillary to nonprofit organization mission sensing the threat the pressed lawmakers to make sure that the new tax   not apply to money from school sports programs accordingly congressional committee reports declared that athletic activities of schools are substantially related to their educational functions even citing the supposed educational benefits of football and basketball so an escape hatch was opened for college sports over the years the has periodically tried to close it in the late the agency looked at the relatively new stream of television revenue from college games and considered treating it as taxable unrelated business income this ignited spirited lobbying campaign by colleges and the until the retreated declaring that selling tickets to fans who go to the school stadium was not all that different from broadcasting games to television audience clearly the did not foresee the commercialized power  that college sports   become driven by national television viewership for example in the big east conference first year of operation in it earned for the right to broadcast all of its games three decades later espn   offer more than million for those rights other attempts to tax college sports profits have been mostly rejected by lawmakers in the congress did an end run around the and decreed that corporate sponsorships did not amount to advertising which   be subject to the unrelated business income tax it was not until the recently approved republican tax plan that lawmakers reversed course eliminating partial deduction for booster donations tied to the sale of game tickets and imposing an excise tax on college employee salaries exceeding million over all however most athletics revenue  s to flow tax free that means the college sports machine keeps cranking out expensive entertainment and the scandals that go with it while sheltered by the scholastic equivalent of cayman islands tax dodge if president

themselves through both  s and their own words wanted to represent the anger and the power that come with facing your abuser in court which is what saw on every face as searched through  s from the hearing the   editor beth flynn kept editors on top of this for the next couple of days to help search through images and get permission for  s from other organizations also called on the graphics editor josh williams who wrote the application that powers the digital presentation advertisement     the main   by the end of friday when the number of accusers was estimated at and more than had

    the main   carla took on the heroic task of listening to every second of the sentencing hearing recording names who was there who spoke publicly and who spoke anonymously as she listened she marked   and transcribed quotations that she thought were compelling or   work well in the   as she listened was in our   database working alongside our   editors to track down every single name was

to create silhouetted drawing to include in the grid online to stand in for the anonymous speakers there were multiple   as pulled up yet another   of woman facing her abuser in court that wanted to burst into tears at my desk the reason visual  telling is so compelling is because it creates an intense connection between you and the subject it also the reason creating these pieces can wear on you carla concurred much of what heard during the hearing was not new to me but it still kept me awake at night she said understood the scope of the problem long before now but seeing and hearing the women speak simultaneously broke my heart and inspired me gymnastics requires particular combination of dedication strength and grace so it fitting to me that it was group of gymnasts and other athletes who finally exposed this unprecedented scale of abuse and who stood their ground in court made their stories public and proved the power of women standing together to amplify one another

supported by magazine is it better to trust the process or to change it first words by marc tracy march     the main   share this page     the main     credit illustration by derek brahney when year old named sam hinkie became president and general manager of the philadelphia ers in the team was middling franchise whose city like most cities felt it had won fewer titles than it deserved one route to actually winning those titles seemed clear championships are won by teams with superstar and preferably two or three the most efficient way to secure such superstars is through the annual draft and the draft rules give an advantage to the teams with the worst records as hinkie took the reins fans quickly concluded that he was preparing to attempt novel strategy the sixers   tank deliberately fielding poor teams whose bottom of the league finishes   net them high draft picks this   take while to bring positive results but hinkie implored fans to ignore the team losses and look at the big picture we talk lot about process he said not outcome within couple of years this process had become the process and the phrase trust the process had become catechism for certain brand of fan joel embiid one of the first and biggest talents hinkie plan brought to philadelphia even adopted the nickname the process fans in philadelphia have been known to chant trust the process as he steps up to take free throws over time hinkie plan started to look as if it was working quite well perhaps too well last year full season after the polarizing hinkie submitted page letter of resignation the proposed new draft procedures that   make losing less attractive sports are defined by clear rules predictable mechanics and unambiguous results you really can devise workable system around them the same goes for game like blackjack in which your chances are consistent the dealer behavior is printed right on the table and everyone agrees on what makes good outcome the odds may be against you casinos are after all business but there really is an objectively correct way to play many hands even when you lose the process remains sound real life is not at all like blackjack and yet the same faith in process crops up in even the messiest realms late last year white   spokesman dismissed fears over robert mueller investigation by suggesting that the administration should be as sanguine as one of its lawyers take deep breath follow ty cobb lead trust the process anthony scaramucci during his abbreviated reign as white   communications director argued for health care system that   trust the process of the free market like in telecom like in airlines those industries of notoriously satisfied consumers two years ago new yorker article mentioned one person who adopted trust the process mantra while taking an improv class he left his career in venture capital and got into buddhist podcast     the main   advertisement     the main   process can be soothing we defer to it almost out of habit as if it is machine that will resolve all conflicts so long as we can resist meddling with its workings but what if those workings and the conflicts behind them are precisely what we should be meddling with and arguing over the difference between process and any old series of events is that process is designed to lead to an outcome legal trial is in theory classic process two antagonists have their say under fair terms and agree to abide by the result one absurdity in kafka the trial is that the trial thing whose entire purpose is to produce an ending does not end the original german title is der process among the united states most cherished processes is the one enshrined in the fifth amendment and later the fourteenth no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the set of rights we ve come to think of as due process is process at its best offering whole litany of protections designed to minimize wrongful convictions presumption of innocence the right to an attorney the requirement that guilt be proved to an exceptionally high standard our generous conception of due process is source of national pride so much so that we some  come to expect it in every area of life advertisement     the main   for the past several months this has been the question raised as men are accused of sexual misbehavior or misconduct what kind of process might the accused be owed before suffering any consequences e ly if those consequences are as informal as having people generally despise you or demand your resignation from high profile job this is an open and debatable question and there are people in position to propose concrete answers to it and yet we ve often seen them call for process as way to avoid taking any clear position when white   adviser rob porter resigned amid reports of domestic abuse president trump tweeted is there no such thing any longer as due process but he was not to all appearances suggesting that porter be

ranking position on the   judiciary committee she declined to give an answer invoking process lets us delegate our own judgments to some ostensibly neutral mechanism system that will formally decide

wanted to all along columbia university for instance has declined to negotiate with union formed by its graduate students even after that union was approved by the national labor relations board and

led by donald fraser and george mcgovern peacenik senator from south dakota proposed changes to the primaries that   transfer power from party bosses to the rank and file three presidential elections later after the candidates this new system encouraged including mcgovern failed to thrive democrats changed the rules again swinging authority back to party loyalists with the creation of superdelegates in those superdelegates came to seem to supporters of an insurgent bernie sanders like an emblem of the party establishment preference for the presumptive nominee hillary clinton at the

of superdelegates and opening caucuses to absentee participation many in the party have joined in support of these changes no less than tim kaine clinton handpicked running mate tweeted early this

advertisementsupported bynews analysiswhy russia tried to cheat its way to gloryimagepresident vladimir putin with russian athletes at the winter olympics in sochi creditmikhail klimentyev agence france presse getty imagesby rebecca ruizdec lausanne switzerland what do you think about your new president you are shocked the man posing the question to me was mikhail kusnirovich owner of russia largest department store he and donald trump had tried to strike deal to bring the miss universe pageant to red square years before he said he went on to answer his own question think he going to be good it was december in mr kusnirovich office overlooking the kremlin weeks before united states intelligence agencies   publicly conclude that russia had interfered in the election in the interest of tilting it toward mr trump nesting dolls with the american president elect face stared out of stalls at the holiday markets but the topic at hand for me was not election meddling but rather russia sophisticated cheating at the winter olympics in sochi russia two subversions of global sports and american democracy have more in common than you may think both involve intelligence agents russia will to win and the same cyberespionage team both have prompted millions of dollars of investigations and challenged public confidence in the purity of sport and in the strength of democracy the two breaches are at the heart of how president vladimir putin has suggested he wants to reclaim russia past by weakening western democracy and dominating world sports mr kusnirovich belonged to group of prominent public figures focused on restoring russian sports to good global standing the group was created last summer by mr putin after revelations that the nation had stolen medals in sochi by relying on steroid laced martinis hundreds of ounces of stockpiled clean urine and the overnight stealth of the country federal security service the kremlin dismissed the details of both schemes as absurd but on tuesday russia was barred from the winter games for its state backed cheating some individual russian athletes may compete independently in neutral uniforms but the russian flag will not appear when the games begin in pyeongchang south korea the details of the sports scandal deconstructed by russian whistle blowers who have provided rare insider insights offer perhaps the purest case study of russia drive to dominate its brazen methods and in part its motivation to influence the american presidency in declassified intelligence report released early this year united states officials said russia attacks on the election had been for mr putin partial payback for the doping scandal which he repeatedly called an american led effort to defame russia last month as new medals were stripped from russian olympians mr putin said the disqualifications were the united states attempt to undermine his re election in fact sports regulators and investigators who conducted the multiple investigations into russia doping are headquartered in canada and the olympic leadership in charge of disqualifying athletes is based in switzerland it was the former president of that staunchly neutral country samuel schmid who conducted the latest investigation for the olympic committee resulting in tuesday sanctions in scrutinizing russia sports and antidoping officials have said they acted on objective forensic and scientific evidence of russia fraud documents data lab analyses and glass bottles of urine with telltale signs of tampering just as allies of the   counsel robert mueller have done this year in the context of the election inquiry the officials have defended their impartiality and interest in plain facts three key whistle blowers helped provide those facts grigory rodchenkov russia former longtime chief antidoping chemist as well as yuliya and vitaly stepanov former russian runner and former employee of the nation antidoping agency all now live in the united states in undisclosed locations from which they have spoken openly about years of coordinated cheating the justice department too has taken interest in their evidence dr rodchenkov whose personal diaries cataloged each day of cheating in sochi came to the united states only after vitaly mutko russia deputy prime minister and former sports minister asked him to resign in light of growing global suspicions about the extent of the nation cheating which the chemist had helped mastermind   we also have meeting how to come from defensive to offensive dr rodchenkov wrote to me in an email on nov having initially denied wrongdoing in our early exchanges at that meeting mr mutko effectively dismissed him and set off dramatic chain of events freedom he wrote in another email that night dr rodchenkov tell all account reported in the   in may and detailed in the documentary icarus culminated in russia olympic ban this week it was instrumental in motivating some russian officials to temper their rigid denials and acknowledge that an institutional conspiracy had existed though they maintained it had not been state sponsored still before this week final sanctions were announced global athletes antidoping advocates and some sponsors had expressed concern about growing crisis in international sports pointing to the long delay by both regulators and olympic officials in responding to evidence of widespread cheating that went even beyond sochi as those critics wondered when or if sports officials   penalize russia for its systematic transgressions by rescinding olympic medals and condemning the state supported schemes they questioned not just fundamental frailties in drug testing controls but also the independence of antidoping authorities one year later similar basic questions about separation of power have taken on renewed relevance in american politics as result of russia breaches those questions have followed mr trump repeated attacks on the independence of the justice department in defiance of the post watergate norms intended to insulate law enforcement from partisan and personal agendas in the same way that mr trump has avoided acknowledging evidence of russia interference in the election thomas bach president of the international olympic committee took more than year to accept the extensive evidence of russia interference in the sochi olympic lab operations other sports officials such as the president of skiing governing body initially told me that the evidence on russia was conspiratorial or too hollywood just as some republican lawmakers have doubted the legitimacy of mr mueller mandate in drawing out his decision making until this week mr bach called for due process and stressed the importance of giving russia fair chance to defend itself one defense came just after the early penalties for russian athletes at the olympics set of cyberattacks group known as fancy bear which american intelligence officials tied to russia main military intelligence unit the published the hacked private medical records of top american athletes as well as the private emails of antidoping officials who had lobbied for ban on russia the hackers the same group that stole emails from the democratic national committee servers and released them ahead of the election called the athlete records proof of illegal drug use by stars such as simone biles and serena williams all athletes had received necessary clearances to use the substances in question and none of the information constituted violation in fiery interview in moscow last year mr mutko the former sports minister and current deputy prime minister echoed mr putin arguing that russia had been disadvantaged globally in sports as in all things he said the decks were stacked against the nation this week he was barred from attending any future olympics though he remains at the helm of russia soccer world cup somebody has to take the responsibility he said in

team mckayla maroney has accused team doctor of sexually abusing her over period of years creditdoug mills the  by juliet macuroct there were more names of course there were in gymnastics and in so many other sports swimming and judo and hockey and basketball there are always more girls more women more names this time the brave athlete stepping forward was mckayla maroney an olympic champion who posted twitter message on wednesday morning that was shocking yet sadly not so shocking at all was molested by dr larry nassar the team doctor for the us women national gymnastics team and olympic team maroney wrote adding her name to the growing list of gymnasts who have accused nassar of abusing them and to the growing list of women deciding to share their stories people should know that this is not just happening in hollywood maroney wrote reference to the harvey weinstein revelations that have become me too phenomenon on social media this is happening everywhere have my own me too stories many women do and to be crystal clear my experiences were very different from what maroney and the other gymnasts have described which includes accusations of serious crimes doctor molesting dozens of minors during his long career but distinguishing levels of harassment or abuse or rape is not the point of any of this the point is to stop this all of this so far more than women including athletes who competed at the highest levels of gymnastics have come forward to say that nassar had touched them inappropriately during medical appointments unlike weinstein nassar is in jail awaiting trial on multiple counts of criminal sexual conduct he already has pleaded guilty to child pornography charges he denies the many accusations of sexual assault and faces decades of prison time regardless of how many charges are leveled or how many lawsuits are filed we might never know how many young gymnasts have stories similar to the one maroney told on wednesday it sickens me to consider that there are probably many many more but now we know maroney was one of them and odds are she won be the last to raise her hand to say me too maroney said her abuse at the hands of nassar began when she was on tuesday the former soviet gymnast and olympic gold medalist tatiana gutsu also said me too gutsu did so on facebook accusing not doctor but an ex olympic teammate vitaly scherbo of raping her in when she was this is me being brave after years gutsu wrote she called scherbo monster who kept me in my own prison to be afraid for so many years imagemaroney won gold medal at the summer games in london years after she said team doctor abused his position to sexually assault her creditchang lee the  if you re taken aback by this wave of raw honesty and surprised by the sheer numbers of me too posts out there then you re probably not woman to so many of us too many of us none of this is new during congressional hearing about sexual abuse in sports in march rick adams the chief of paralympic sports for the united states olympic committee sat between two gymnasts and testified that the olympic community failed the people it supposed to protect those people who remained unprotected were athletes young ones older ones ones who have had to carry the burden of abuse for years their lips zipped and their hearts heavy ones whose parents had entrusted them to coaches adults who were supposed to keep those children safe ones who attended national gymnastics team training camps at bela and martha karolyi rural texas ranch where nassar often met with the gymnasts in their rooms alone and molested them some of the athletes whispered among themselves that they felt uncomfortable with nassar so called techniques but the stories stayed secrets the gymnasts careers were on the line wherever there is position of power there seems to be potential for abuse maroney wrote had dream to go to the olympics and the things that had to endure to get there were unnecessary and disgusting the nassars and the weinsteins of the world who haven been outed yet should be worried about me too because now that women can see that they re not alone more will speak up because so many of them have stories to tell like me there was the time when covered nascar in the and was cornered by top driver in the back of his trailer while trying to conduct an interview as the cars roared around the racetrack he blocked the door and said he  n let me leave unless kissed him the team publicist saved me by knocking on the door or the time when another driver kept putting his hand on my leg as sat next to him during group interview or the meeting at the olympics where man in public relations threw himself at me hands grabbing as soon as he closed his office door forcing me to talk my way out of the room thought all of those experiences were just par for the course for woman in sports and in many ways it turns out they were but those moments were degrading and frustrating and isolating after all just wanted to do my job like anyone else and so never shared those details  n believe that ended up in those situations and was embarrassed without the boldness of so many other women as so many of them join hands to pull back the curtain on this problem still might have preferred to say nothing that silence is exactly what abusers are counting on they can count on it

supported by books tell us things about your book inside the fevered minds of sports fans by john williamsfeb     the main   share this page     the main     credit patricia wall the   if you ve never had your heart broken or your nerves thoroughly frayed by sporting event you know someone who has as young journalist at the los angeles   in the george dohrmann   field late night phone calls from rabid fans he wondered being fan himself why the depth of their devotion mystified him my blindness to the root causes of their thinking and conduct was also ignorance about myself he writes in his new book superfans into the heart of obsessive sports fandom dohrmann who spent time as an investigative reporter at sports illustrated and is now senior editor at the athletic spoke to everyday fans academics and scientists about what it is that drives our vicarious competitive mania below he talks about whether kids should be fans his admiration for the soccer player clint dempsey and more when did you first get the idea to write this book it long been curiosity of mine why people were so intense about their favorite team certainly had my favorites throughout my life as young person it was notre dame football and growing up in california the giants in baseball and the warriors in basketball most of those teams fell away but what became my one true obsession was the united states men national soccer team but never on the level that   see from people both as young journalist and then later when was doing investigative journalism on colleges getting death threats from fans who were upset what is it that makes people this passionate love sports too but how did they get there then had kids have an eight year old and five year old and started asking myself about fandom and how to introduce it to them it all came together three or four years ago it felt like the moment professionally and personally for me to dive into this book there are so many books that explore someone individual fandom but those aren that accessible if not red sox fan not going to read book about red sox fan thought if you wrote something that introduced different people from around the country that was more approachable way to analyze fandom     the main   advertisement     the main   what the most surprising thing you learned while writing it   george dohrmann credit adam moore talked to susan harter renowned child psychologist about how kids receive their parents fandom she told me that we shouldn be introducing our kids to fandom until adolescence this runs contrary to what we do we put baby in green bay packers onesie this is what we see all the time and we celebrate it posting pictures of it and saying how cute it is but kid wrote about an eagles fan was just melting down in youtube videos while the patriots were beating his team harter said kids want to see the world in black and white they want to divide the world into good and bad and sports does that but the kids don understand that the fact that their teacher is an auburn fan doesn make them bad person they don understand that daddy going to be when his team loses they lack perspective they can say well it been good season even though we lost this game some  now watch game outside the home so my kids don see me yelling at the tv and see that it important to me don want them to make it important right now

fan athlete engagement in the book more opportunities for athletes to confront the fans who often say critical things about them thought that   make for good   and did reach out to some athletes but ultimately concluded that part of fandom blazing is what they call it that troll behavior while it exists it felt like falling into trap just looking at the worst of fans there is some bad behavior in the book but it felt too voyeuristic to keep highlighting these really extreme negative fans advertisement     the main   who is creative person not writer who has influenced you and your work for long time my favorite national team player was clint dempsey liked him because he was successful but loved how he was successful and why loved that he grew up poor and had to go outside the traditional soccer development system he wasn put on the conveyor belt to greatness that inspiring someone who works outside the system and still gets to the top of it he   take risks on the field it was like he was saying going to try for greatness and might look foolish some  and it might not work out but going to shoot for greatness here that was something to love and admire about him and something that anyone can bring into their own work we have to take shots here persuade someone to read superfans in words or less lot of people wonder about sports fans behavior they might be

capital and the making of millennials by malcolm harris pp little brown   when will someone stick up for millennials we have been sheltered by our parents swindled by our universities deadened by our therapists and for all this our reward has been glib condescension from the boomer press rising to our defense is harris our peer born as the book cover notes familiar provocateur from the internet left flank harris contends that america has stiffed our generation filling childhoods with homework and extracurricular activities all of this ostensibly served to prepare us for college and fruitful careers when really all it resulted in was the almost inevitable heartbreak of falling short of our parents expectations and ours harris spins recognizable   of hostile job market characterized by declines in worker solidarity and wages he uses the concept of human capital to analyze how much time millennials have invested in themselves by way of schoolwork and for what every authority from moms to presidents told millennials to accumulate as much human capital as we   and we did but the market hasn held up its end of the bargain he brings fresh contrarian eye to some of the usual data points he sees in the obama era nationalization of student debt not an aid to youngsters but goofy scheme to stimulate consumer demand for rising tuition costs at america public universities he blames greedy administrators rather than benighted state legislatures he argues that millennials deserved loot has been hoarded by the ownership class and seniors who have saved entitlement programs that serve them as steady government jobs disappear and the social safety net withers he also broadens his survey to cover school discipline and youtube stars and he makes surprising case that sexting isn as harmful as it cracked up to be advertisement     the main   as generational advocates go we   do worse than harris but he ends his book with fatalism nearly as flippant as the generational critiques he loathes despite this moment of political fellowship among millennials he writes off the possibility of meaningful change coming from government or social movements once we take over not optimistic myself no but what is our generation if not rich in skills we may yet put to good use     the main   advertisement     the main   the selfie generation how our self images are changing our notions of privacy sex consent and culture by alicia eler pp skyhorse   the social internet has been gripped in recent weeks by an app google arts and culture which relies on total trust from its users or perhaps their total lack of concern for privacy the app encourages users to take and upload selfies so that google facial recognition algorithm might compare them to its vast digital art archive google says it does not store the selfies one year ago our generation was donating to the now we re taking  s of ourselves for multinational corporation that has cooperated with the government surveillance programs such is the allure of the selfie eler who is the visual arts critic for the star tribune in minnesota and also millennial has published for years on the selfie and its implications for privacy self expression and sex in the selfie she finds an aspirational image essential to being seen by others online she sees the selfie as lifeline to those who struggle to be represented in the media ecosystem she mentions transpeople and agoraphobes and not all selfie takers she proves are as oblivious as imagined unfortunately eler book   have benefited from more careful edit her discursive style is some  whimsical but mostly distracting she dwells on topic having little to do with selfies and then glosses over complicated selfie related stories fake news in the election gets at least seven pages the macaque who took selfie and then saw peta sue for his copyright gets just two she provides an extended discussion of blogs that post screenshots of bad tinder conversations but glosses over the july facebook live stream by diamond reynolds after her husband philando castile was shot by the police and while there are moments where her light touch suits the material well section on social media surveillance at standing rock is hindered by her choice to discuss it through quoting meeting she had over coffee with protester in spite of its flaws though eler book alights on the source of the selfie power it is the easiest way to assert one humanity in our hyper networked world perhaps our much fussed over narcissism is not flaw but survival tactic igen why   super connected kids are growing up less rebellious more tolerant less happy and completely unprepared for adulthood by jean twenge pp atria   back in the psychologist twenge swiped at millennials in her book generation me she wrote then that we were miserable entitled narcissists ruined by our parents adoration she was trying to rebut neil howe and the late william strauss the gurus of generational theory who had contended in that civic oriented millennials   become the next great generation time has evidently softened her advertisement     the main   her new igen pities rather than disdains those born after arguing that smartphone addiction has saddled new generation with profound psychological problems including sleep deprivation depression and unshakable senses of loneliness and fear they drink less and have less sex they socialize less without their parents present they hardly read for pleasure or go to the mall they eschew church and even spirituality they kill themselves more but others less they wait longer to get drivers licenses and give birth twenge premises her conclusions on longitudinal studies of high schoolers and college students which she supplements with first person accounts from members of igen she concludes by offering this advice do not sleep with it or give it nude pictures of yourself it is not your lover do not continuously turn your attention to it when you are talking with someone in person it is not your best friend twenge is right to highlight smartphones contributions to our malaise in one section she notes the feeling of rejection that arises from text sent without an immediate response and in another she notes that more screen time leads to less in person socializing which breeds loneliness she   stand to incorporate some of harris alarm about the economy she duly recognizes income inequality as prime source of igen anxiety about its future but while she discusses how smartphones do their harm she has no such harsh words for the modern labor market instead she tells marketers how to exploit igen diminished expectations which struck me as tacky and not particularly useful besides the kids may spend

an athletic program but years ago it ran profitable macaroni company leading indirectly to decision by congress that college sports if not college owned noodle business should be exempt from taxation   as the hugely lucrative football bowl season wraps up colleges fear that the new tax law signed by president trump   derail their gravy train two provisions target coaches high salaries and booster donations tied to ticket purchases but they need not worry much there are no plans to start taxing television revenue and corporate sponsorships two of the biggest income streams which together transformed intercollegiate athletics into multibillion dollar business even with the legislative changes collegiate sports remain largely tax exempt the beneficiary of public subsidy that is increasingly difficult to defend the corrosive culture of money in big time college sports more than billion year among the national collegiate athletic association division sports programs was painfully obvious recently with the indictments of college coaches and an adidas executive charged with paying bribes to recruit basketball players and steer them to agents advertisement     the main   it was left to federal prosecutors to issue statement condemning the criminal influence of money on coaches and student athletes     the main   advertisement     the main   the tax exempt nature of college sports is not the cause of these problems rather it is rocket fuel for an engine that has escaped the gravitational pull of common sense and decency to understand how this is possible consider the balance sheet of the atlantic coast conference home of the national champions in football clemson and men basketball north carolina its corporate sponsors include toyota gatorade and geico when the conference filed its annual tax return for it reported about quarter billion dollars from broadcasting games for its member universities as well as million in other sports related revenue its commissioner earned million the was huge commercial success with income that   normally generate huge tax bill but no taxes were owed as the conference explained in its filing with the internal revenue service the atlantic coast and its member schools are nonprofit charitable organizations that place an emphasis on academic excellence the atlantic coast conference it said seeks to maximize the educational and athletic opportunities of its student athletes while enriching their quality of life the magic word here is educational student athletes have always been considered unpaid amateurs engaging in extracurricular activities rather than profitable professions so college sports is deemed part of the educational mission of schools and exempt from income taxes there are specific and contentious interpretations of law that prop up this assumption in the modern era but they have weakened as big time college sports has taken on the trappings of profit driven business far removed from the cloistered groves of academe it is only through decades of aggressive lobbying and legal battles that universities have managed to avoid income taxes on billions of dollars from broadcast rights sponsorships and donations from boosters the seminal moment came in response to an attempt by to extend its tax exempt status to profits generated by mueller company pasta maker that had been donated to its law school in congress took notice and eventually enacted the unrelated business income tax to capture revenue considered ancillary to nonprofit organization mission sensing the threat the pressed lawmakers to make sure that the new tax   not apply to money from school sports programs accordingly congressional committee reports declared that athletic activities of schools are

sports over the years the has periodically tried to close it in the late the agency looked at the relatively new stream of television revenue from college games and considered treating it as taxable

profits have been mostly rejected by lawmakers in the congress did an end run around the and decreed that corporate sponsorships did not amount to advertising which   be subject to the unrelated business income tax it was not until the recently approved republican tax plan that lawmakers reversed course eliminating partial deduction for booster donations tied to the sale of game tickets and

hearing credit matthew dae smith lansing state journal via associated press the sentencing hearing for lawrence nassar the former gymnastics team doctor who was accused by scores of women of sexual abuse many when they were minors was already an anomaly when it began on jan in michigan eighty eight women were expected to give victim impact statements in court and just the day before simone biles one of the best athletes ever to grace the olympic games had joined the rising chorus of voices with statement posted on twitter as former gymnast always have one ear tuned to that world and was wondering why the media coverage of the case felt so slim few other outlets were reporting the   including the indianapolis star which broke the news in august carla correa digital news editor with whom had partnered to cover women gymnastics during the rio olympics was also wondering and voiced her frustration in group message on slack we wondered what we   do with the resources of the   in the few days between statements and sentencing to amplify the voices of these women it was easily the largest number of accusers in sexual abuse case in sports hi  what   we do in the short time we had to communicate the staggering scale the deputy editor on our digital news design desk team whose task is to find opportunities to use visuals to tell compelling   wanted to let the women represent themselves through both  s and their own words wanted to represent the anger and the power that come with facing your abuser in court which is what saw on every face as searched through  s from the hearing the   editor beth flynn kept editors on top of this for the next couple of days to help search through images and get permission for  s from other organizations also called on the graphics editor josh williams who wrote the application that powers the digital presentation advertisement     the main   by the end of friday when the number of accusers was estimated at and more than had signed up to speak we knew we   have another few days of statements before sentencing over the weekend and into monday carla and spent much of our time collecting material     the main   advertisement     the main   carla took on the heroic task of listening to every second of the sentencing hearing recording names who was there who spoke publicly and who spoke anonymously as she listened she marked   and transcribed quotations that she thought were compelling or   work well in the   as she listened was in our   database working alongside our   editors to track down every single name was determined to gather as many portraits as we   to represent as many women as possible for those who chose to remain anonymous but still spoke in court reached out to one of our art directors agnes lee to create silhouetted drawing to include in the grid online to stand in for the anonymous speakers there were multiple   as pulled up yet another   of woman facing her abuser in court that wanted to burst into tears at my desk the reason visual  telling is so compelling is because it creates an intense connection between you and the subject it also the reason creating these pieces can wear on you carla concurred much of what heard during the hearing was not new to me but it still kept me awake at night she said understood the scope of the problem long before now but seeing and hearing the women speak simultaneously broke my heart and inspired me gymnastics requires particular combination of dedication strength and grace so it fitting to me that it was group of gymnasts and other athletes who finally exposed this unprecedented scale of abuse and who stood their ground in court made their stories public and proved the power of women standing together to amplify one another

thursday creditsaeed khan agence france presse getty imageswe all have our reasons for watching sports but at the forefront of mine is watching incredible athletes do incredible things they do things we cannot and it is magical want to see them thrive do not want to see them struggle for air thursday afternoon in melbourne at the australian open the french tennis player ga monfils in the middle of tense match against novak djokovic one of the greatest players of all time begged for help the surface temperature on the court registered at degrees celsius or degrees fahrenheit sick to the stomach monfils told the judges monfils one of the most athletic and fit players on the tour at the year first major wasn just hot he was scared tired and dizzy he went on he thought he had small heat stroke for minutes he staggered off the court between sets gasping going to collapse the response of the chair umpire in charge of the event was not here is some water or let take break or even good news ga this place has roof let close it it was instead reminder that players are allowed only second break between points so get back out there afterward djokovic who won the match but looked as haggard and sickly as monfils did said there is limit and that is level of guess tolerance between being fit and being think in danger in terms of health   was right at the limit when you watch two world class professionals barely able to lift their rackets in one of their sport signature events you can help but wonder what exactly we re trying to prove here reason we watch sports is to see the planet most talented dedicated athletes perform at the highest levels to see true physical genius in their chosen pursuits it is not to watch them perform at fraction of their abilities because they can hardly stand there has long been fetishization of athletes being able to withstand the elements to overcome them en route to victory the marathoner who survives degree temperatures the football player who braves frigid weather to win the big game but why to appreciate true genius is to see it uninhibited by exterior circumstances to see it in its purest natural element sports are entertainment and part of that entertainment is to see athletic genius at work why   we want to see wonderful athlete unable to be his or her best because it absurdly hot or cold outside the beauty is in the performance not what surrounds it   you appreciate say daniel day lewis performance more because it was done in storage freezer or in the middle of blazing desert never mind that knowing him he probably still win an oscar isn the art itself enough the has constructed whole cottage industry out of frozen tundra as spectacle all born from the infamous ice bowl of the championship game in which the packers outlasted the cowboys at lambeau field in conditions where the wind chill reached about minus degrees fahrenheit but that game is compelling only as lore in the moment it was virtually unwatchable and barely even resembled football during the game the packers quarterback bart starr got frostbite in his fingers the linebacker ray nitschke frostbite was so awful his toenails fell off the marching band in attendance  n play because the woodwinds froze after whistling for kickoff the referee norm schachter realized that his whistle was stuck to his lips when he tried to remove it the skin ripped from his mouth the refs stopped using their whistles after that and communicated by screaming for play to stop fan in the stands died this was not football this was simply bunch of men trying not to freeze to death and yet the game is still talked about as classic decades later to the detriment not just of the men and women who play but of the pleasure of the fans who watch them weather does not enhance the enjoyment of sports it stands in the way we watch sports to see great quarterback throw perfect pass to win the big game we do not watch the ball hit stiff wind and flutter like wounded duck   anyone want to watch basketball game where jump shots   be blown off course what   that tell us about who was the better team to watch the monfils djokovic match was to watch two men wilting and withering away neither looked like even close to the star tennis players we ve seen them both be for years closing the roof and providing climate controlled environment to play every sport in optimal conditions for athletes to thrive  n just be more humane to the players it   be far more enjoyable to watch we want to see athletes do incredible things that we cannot we do not want to see them

started to look as if it was working quite well perhaps too well last year full season after the polarizing hinkie submitted page letter of resignation the proposed new draft procedures that   make losing less attractive sports are defined by clear rules predictable mechanics and unambiguous results you really can devise workable system around them the same goes for game like blackjack in which your chances are consistent the dealer behavior is printed right on the table and everyone agrees on what makes good outcome the odds may be against you casinos are after all business but there really is an objectively correct way to play many hands even when you lose the process remains sound real life is not at all like blackjack and yet the same faith in process crops up in even the messiest realms late last year white   spokesman dismissed fears over robert mueller investigation by suggesting that the administration should be as sanguine as one of its lawyers take deep breath follow ty cobb lead trust the process anthony scaramucci during his abbreviated reign as white   communications director argued for health care system that   trust the process of the free market like in telecom

career in venture capital and got into buddhist podcast process can be soothing we defer to it almost out of habit as if it is machine that will resolve all conflicts so long as we can resist meddling with its workings but what if those workings and the conflicts behind them are precisely what we should be meddling with and arguing over the difference between process and any old series of events is that process is designed to lead to an outcome legal trial is in theory classic process two antagonists have their say under fair terms and agree to abide by the result one absurdity in kafka the trial is that the trial thing whose entire purpose is to produce an ending does not end the original german title is der process among the united states most cherished processes is the one enshrined in the fifth amendment and later the fourteenth no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the set of rights we ve come to think of as due process is process at its best offering whole litany of protections designed to minimize wrongful convictions presumption of innocence the right to an attorney the requirement that guilt be proved to an exceptionally high standard our generous conception of due process is source of national pride so much so that we some  come to expect it in every area of life for the past several months this has been the question raised as men are accused of sexual misbehavior or misconduct what kind of process might the accused be owed before suffering any consequences e ly if those consequences are as informal as having people generally despise you or demand your resignation from high profile job this is an open and debatable question and there are people in position to propose concrete answers to it and yet we ve often seen them call for process as way to avoid taking any clear position when white   adviser rob porter resigned amid reports of domestic abuse president trump tweeted is there no such thing any longer as due process but he was not to all appearances suggesting that porter be tried in court of law and if porter deserved some formal hearing before departing his job surely it was the trump administration itself that   have to provide it late last november as pressure built on representative john conyers to resign over accusations of sexual harassment the   minority leader nancy pelosi appeared on meet the press and maintained that we are strengthened by due process when asked how she might use her own powers to address the situation she   for instance have suspended him from his ranking position on the   judiciary committee she declined to give an answer invoking process lets us delegate our own judgments to some ostensibly neutral mechanism system that will formally decide things that might be difficult for us to decide ourselves but it can also absolve us of the responsibility to engage with the questions around us it can offer us cover for taking the positions we wanted to all along columbia university for instance has declined to negotiate with union formed by its graduate students even after that union was approved by the national labor relations board and voted on by the students themselves stance that will push the matter into further litigation we have declined to bargain the university provost said in january until the legal process has been allowed to run its course this is one kind of language process can speak sorry it seems to say our hands are tied we re forced to let this play out in precisely the way we already preferred in as the police beat protesters outside the democrats presidential convention in chicago the party establishment inside nominated the hawkish hubert humphrey even though majority of primary voters had supported robert kennedy or eugene mccarthy candidates who advocated quicker exit from the vietnam war it e ly disappointing to people my age college sophomore from new mexico told the   afterward the adults told us to trust the political process but process is not magical ritual it is designed to accomplish something specific and if it fails it can be redesigned of the constitutional amendments ratified since the bill of rights have changed the rules of voting and representation and after humphrey was defeated by richard nixon the democrats found themselves revisiting their primary system commission led by donald fraser and george mcgovern peacenik senator from south dakota proposed changes to the primaries that   transfer power from party bosses to the rank and file three presidential elections later after the candidates this new system encouraged including mcgovern failed to thrive democrats changed the rules again swinging authority back to party loyalists with the creation of superdelegates in those superdelegates came to seem to supporters of an insurgent bernie sanders like an emblem of the party establishment preference for the presumptive nominee hillary clinton at the party convention the democratic national committee created another commission to examine voting processes it issued its recommendations late in including measures like drastically reducing the number of superdelegates and opening caucuses to absentee participation many in the party have joined in support of these changes no less than tim kaine clinton handpicked running mate tweeted early this month we democrats need to do away with superdelegates once and for all they are given undue influence and make the presidential nominating process less democratic but even explaining those

advertisementsupported bysports of the  the me too movement inevitably spills into sportsimagethe united states won the team gold in women gymnastics at the london olympics at least one member of the team mckayla maroney has accused team doctor of sexually abusing her over period of years creditdoug mills the  by juliet macuroct there were more names of course there were in gymnastics and in so many other sports swimming and judo and hockey and basketball there are always more girls more women more names this time the brave athlete stepping forward was mckayla maroney an olympic champion who posted twitter message on wednesday morning that was shocking yet sadly not so shocking at all was molested by dr larry nassar the team doctor for the us women national gymnastics team and olympic team maroney wrote adding her name to the growing list of gymnasts who have accused nassar of abusing them and to the growing list of women deciding to share their stories people should know that this is not just happening in hollywood maroney wrote reference to the harvey weinstein revelations that have become me too phenomenon on social media this is happening everywhere have my own me too stories many women do and to be crystal clear my experiences were very different from what maroney and the other gymnasts have described which includes accusations of serious crimes doctor molesting dozens of minors during his long career but distinguishing levels of harassment or abuse or rape is not the point of any of this the point is to stop this all of this so far more than women including athletes who competed at the highest levels of gymnastics have come forward to say that nassar had touched them inappropriately during medical appointments unlike weinstein nassar is in jail awaiting trial on multiple counts of criminal sexual conduct he already has pleaded guilty to child pornography charges he denies the many accusations of sexual assault and faces decades of prison time regardless of how many charges are leveled or how many lawsuits are filed we might never know how many young gymnasts have stories similar to the one maroney told on wednesday it sickens me to consider that there are probably many many more but now we know maroney was one of them and odds are she won be the last to raise her hand to say me too maroney said her abuse at the hands of nassar began when she was on tuesday the former soviet gymnast and olympic gold medalist tatiana gutsu also said me too gutsu did so on facebook accusing not doctor but an ex olympic teammate vitaly scherbo of raping her in when she was this is me being brave after years gutsu wrote she called scherbo monster who kept me in my own prison to be afraid for so many years imagemaroney won gold medal at the summer games in london years after she said team doctor abused his position to sexually assault her creditchang lee the  if you re taken aback by this wave of raw honesty and surprised by the sheer numbers of me too posts out there then you re probably not woman to so many of us too many of us none of this is new during congressional hearing about sexual abuse in sports in march rick adams the chief of paralympic sports for the united states olympic committee sat between two gymnasts and testified that the olympic community failed the people it supposed to protect those people who remained unprotected were athletes young ones older ones ones who have had to carry the burden of abuse for years their lips zipped and their hearts heavy ones whose parents had entrusted them to coaches adults who were supposed to keep those children safe ones who attended national gymnastics team training camps at bela and martha karolyi rural texas ranch where nassar often met with the gymnasts in their rooms alone and molested them some of the athletes whispered among themselves that they felt uncomfortable with nassar so called techniques but the stories stayed secrets the gymnasts careers were on the line wherever there is position of power there seems to be potential for abuse maroney wrote had dream to go to the olympics and the things that had to endure to get there were unnecessary and disgusting the nassars and the weinsteins of the world who haven been outed yet should be worried about me too because now that women can see that they re not alone more will speak up because so many of them have stories to tell like me there was the time when covered nascar in the and was cornered by top driver in the back of his trailer while trying to conduct an interview as the cars roared around the racetrack he blocked the door and said he  n let me leave unless kissed him the team publicist saved me by knocking on the door or the time when another driver kept putting his hand on my leg as sat next to him during group interview or the meeting at the olympics where man in public relations threw himself at me hands grabbing as soon as he closed his office door forcing me to talk my way out of the room thought all of those experiences were just par for the course for woman in sports and in many ways it turns out they were but those moments were degrading and frustrating and isolating after all just wanted to do my job like anyone else and so never shared those details  n believe that ended up in those situations and was embarrassed without the boldness of so many other women as so many of them join hands to pull back the curtain on this problem still might have preferred to say nothing that silence is exactly what abusers are counting on they can count on it

supported by books tell us things about your book inside the fevered minds of sports fans by john williamsfeb     the main   share this page     the main     credit patricia wall the   if you ve never had your heart broken or your nerves thoroughly frayed by sporting event you know someone who has as young journalist at the los angeles   in the george dohrmann   field late night phone calls from rabid fans he wondered being fan himself why the depth of their devotion mystified him my blindness to the root causes of their thinking and conduct was also ignorance about myself he writes in his new book superfans into the heart of obsessive sports fandom dohrmann who spent time as an investigative reporter at sports illustrated and is now senior editor at the athletic spoke to everyday fans academics and scientists about what it is that drives our vicarious competitive mania below he talks about whether kids should be fans his admiration for the soccer player clint dempsey and more when did you first get the idea to write this book it long been curiosity of mine why people were so intense about their favorite team certainly had my favorites throughout my life as young person it was notre dame football and growing up in california the giants in baseball and the warriors in basketball most of those teams fell away but what became my one true obsession was the united states men national soccer team but never on the level that   see from people both as young journalist and then later when was doing investigative journalism on colleges getting death threats from fans who were upset what is it that makes people this passionate love sports too but how did they get there then had kids have an eight year old and five year old and started asking myself about fandom and how to introduce it to them it all came together three or four years ago it felt like the moment professionally and personally for me to dive into this book there are so many books that explore someone individual fandom but those aren that accessible if not red sox fan not going to read book about red sox fan thought if you wrote something that introduced different people from around the country that was more approachable way to analyze fandom     the main   advertisement     the main   what the most surprising thing you learned while writing it   george dohrmann credit adam moore talked to susan harter renowned child psychologist about how kids receive their parents fandom she told me that we shouldn be introducing our kids to fandom until adolescence this runs contrary to what we do we put baby in green bay packers onesie this is what we see all the time and we celebrate it posting pictures of it and saying how cute it is but kid wrote about an eagles fan was just melting down in youtube videos while the patriots were beating his team harter said kids want to see the world in black and white they want to divide the world into good and bad and sports does that but the kids don understand that the fact that their teacher is an auburn fan doesn make them bad person they don understand that daddy going to be when his team loses they lack perspective they can say well it been good season even though we lost this game some  now watch game outside the home so my kids don see me yelling at the tv and see that it important to me don want them to make it important right now

fan athlete engagement in the book more opportunities for athletes to confront the fans who often say critical things about them thought that   make for good   and did reach out to some athletes but ultimately concluded that part of fandom blazing is what they call it that troll behavior while it exists it felt like falling into trap just looking at the worst of fans there is some bad behavior in the book but it felt too voyeuristic to keep highlighting these really extreme negative fans advertisement     the main   who is creative person not writer who has influenced you and your work for long time my favorite national team player was clint dempsey liked him because he was successful but loved how he was successful and why loved that he grew up poor and had to go outside the traditional soccer development system he wasn put on the conveyor belt to greatness that inspiring someone who works outside the system and still gets to the top of it he   take risks on the field it was like he was saying going to try for greatness and might look foolish some  and it might not work out but going to shoot for greatness here that was something to love and admire about him and something that anyone can bring into their own work we have to take shots here persuade someone to read superfans in words or less lot of people wonder about sports fans behavior they might be

course there were in gymnastics and in so many other sports swimming and judo and hockey and basketball there are always more girls more women more names this time the brave athlete stepping forward was mckayla maroney an olympic champion who posted twitter message on wednesday morning that was shocking yet sadly not so shocking at all was molested by dr larry nassar the team doctor for the us women national gymnastics team and olympic team maroney wrote adding her name to the growing list of gymnasts who have accused nassar of abusing them and to the growing list of women deciding to share their stories people should know that this is not just happening in hollywood maroney wrote reference to the harvey weinstein revelations that have become me too phenomenon on social media this is happening everywhere advertisement     the main   have my own me too stories many women do and to be crystal clear my experiences were very different from what maroney and the other gymnasts have described which includes accusations of serious crimes doctor molesting dozens of minors during his long career but distinguishing levels of harassment or abuse or rape is not the point of any of this the point is to stop this all of this     the main   advertisement     the main   so far more than women including athletes who competed at the highest levels of gymnastics have come forward to say that nassar had touched them inappropriately during medical appointments unlike weinstein nassar is in jail awaiting trial on multiple counts of criminal sexual conduct he already has pleaded guilty to child pornography charges he denies the many accusations of sexual assault and faces decades of prison time regardless of how many charges are leveled or how many lawsuits are filed we might never know how many young gymnasts have stories similar to the one maroney told on wednesday it sickens me to consider that there are probably many many more but now we know maroney was one of them and odds are she won be the last to raise her hand to say me too maroney said her abuse at the hands of nassar began when she was on tuesday the former soviet gymnast and olympic gold medalist tatiana gutsu also said me too gutsu did so on facebook accusing not doctor but an ex olympic teammate vitaly scherbo of raping her in when she was this is me being brave after years gutsu wrote she called scherbo

interfered in the election in the interest of tilting it toward mr trump nesting dolls with the american president elect face stared out of stalls at the holiday markets but the topic at hand for me was not election meddling but rather russia sophisticated cheating at the winter olympics in sochi russia two subversions of global sports and american democracy have more in common than you may think both involve intelligence agents russia will to win and the same cyberespionage team both have prompted millions of dollars of investigations and challenged public confidence in the purity of sport and in the strength of democracy the two breaches are at the heart of how president vladimir putin has suggested he wants to reclaim russia past by weakening western democracy and dominating world sports advertisement     the main   mr kusnirovich belonged to group of prominent public figures focused on restoring russian sports to good global standing the group was created last summer by mr

scandal deconstructed by russian whistle blowers who have provided rare insider insights offer perhaps the purest case study of russia drive to dominate its brazen methods and in part its motivation to influence the american presidency in declassified intelligence report released early this year united states officials said russia attacks on the election had been for mr putin partial payback for the doping scandal which he repeatedly called an american led effort to defame russia last month as new medals were stripped from russian olympians mr putin said the disqualifications were the united states attempt to undermine his re election in fact sports regulators and investigators who conducted the multiple investigations into russia doping are headquartered in canada and the olympic leadership in charge of disqualifying athletes is based in switzerland it was the former president of that staunchly neutral country samuel schmid who conducted the latest investigation for the olympic committee resulting in tuesday sanctions in scrutinizing russia sports and antidoping officials have said they acted on objective forensic and scientific evidence of russia fraud documents data lab analyses and glass bottles of urine with telltale signs of tampering just as allies of the   counsel robert mueller have done this year in the context of the election inquiry the officials

some russian officials to temper their rigid denials and acknowledge that an institutional conspiracy had existed though they maintained it had not been state sponsored still before this week final sanctions were announced global athletes antidoping advocates and some sponsors had expressed concern about growing crisis in international sports pointing to the long delay by both regulators and olympic officials in responding to evidence of widespread cheating that went even beyond sochi as those critics wondered when or if sports officials   penalize russia for its systematic transgressions by rescinding olympic medals and condemning the state supported schemes they questioned not just fundamental frailties in drug testing controls but also the independence of antidoping authorities one year later similar basic questions about separation of power have taken on renewed relevance in american politics as result of russia breaches those questions have followed mr trump repeated attacks on the independence of the justice department in defiance of the post watergate norms intended to insulate law enforcement from partisan and personal agendas in the same way that mr trump has avoided acknowledging evidence of russia interference in the election thomas bach president of the international olympic committee took more than year to accept the extensive evidence of russia interference in the sochi olympic lab operations other sports officials such as the president of skiing governing body initially told me that the evidence on russia was conspiratorial or too hollywood just as some republican lawmakers have doubted the legitimacy of mr mueller mandate in drawing out his decision making until this week mr bach called for due process and stressed the importance of giving russia fair chance to defend itself advertisement     the main   one defense came just after the early penalties for russian athletes at the olympics set of cyberattacks group known as fancy bear which

the almost inevitable heartbreak of falling short of our parents expectations and ours harris spins recognizable   of hostile job market characterized by declines in worker solidarity and wages he uses the concept of human capital to analyze how much time millennials have invested in themselves by way of schoolwork and for what every authority from moms to presidents told millennials to accumulate as much human capital as we   and we did but the market hasn held up its end of the bargain he brings fresh contrarian eye to some of the usual data points he sees in the obama era nationalization of student debt not an aid to youngsters but goofy scheme to stimulate consumer demand for rising tuition costs at america public universities he blames greedy administrators rather than benighted state legislatures he argues that millennials deserved loot has been hoarded by the ownership class and seniors who have saved entitlement programs that serve them as steady government jobs disappear and the social safety net withers he also broadens his survey to cover school discipline and youtube stars and he makes surprising case that sexting isn as harmful as it cracked up to

gripped in recent weeks by an app google arts and culture which relies on total trust from its users or perhaps their total lack of concern for privacy the app encourages users to take and upload selfies so that google facial recognition algorithm might compare them to its vast digital art archive google says it does not store the selfies one year ago our generation was donating to the now we re taking  s of ourselves for multinational corporation that has cooperated with the government surveillance programs such is the allure of the selfie eler who is the visual arts critic for the star tribune in minnesota and also millennial has published for years on the selfie and its implications for privacy self expression and sex in the selfie she finds an aspirational image essential to being seen by others online she sees the selfie as lifeline to those who struggle to be represented in the media ecosystem she mentions transpeople and agoraphobes and not all selfie takers she proves are as oblivious as imagined unfortunately eler book   have benefited from more careful edit her discursive style is some  whimsical but mostly distracting she dwells on topic having little to do with selfies and then glosses over complicated selfie related stories fake news in the election gets at least seven pages the macaque who took selfie and then saw peta sue for his copyright gets just two she provides an extended discussion of blogs that post screenshots of bad tinder conversations but glosses over the july facebook live stream by diamond reynolds after her husband philando castile was shot by the police and while there are moments where her light touch suits the material well section on social media surveillance at standing rock is hindered by her choice to discuss it through quoting meeting she had over coffee with protester in spite of its flaws though eler book alights on the source of the selfie power it is the easiest way to assert one humanity in our hyper networked

has evidently softened her her new igen pities rather than disdains those born after arguing that smartphone addiction has saddled new generation with profound psychological problems including sleep deprivation depression and unshakable senses of loneliness and fear they drink less and have less sex they socialize less without their parents present they hardly read for pleasure or go to the mall they eschew church and even spirituality they kill themselves more but others less they wait longer to get drivers licenses and give birth twenge premises her conclusions on longitudinal studies of high schoolers and college students which she supplements with first person accounts from members of igen she concludes by offering this advice do not sleep with it or give it nude pictures of

thursday creditsaeed khan agence france presse getty imageswe all have our reasons for watching sports but at the forefront of mine is watching incredible athletes do incredible things they do things we cannot and it is magical want to see them thrive do not want to see them struggle for air thursday afternoon in melbourne at the australian open the french tennis player ga monfils in the middle of tense match against novak djokovic one of the greatest players of all time begged for help the surface temperature on the court registered at degrees celsius or degrees fahrenheit sick to the stomach monfils told the judges monfils one of the most athletic and fit players on the tour at the year first major wasn just hot he was scared tired and dizzy he went on he thought he had small heat stroke for minutes he staggered off the court between sets gasping going to collapse the response of the chair umpire in charge of the event was not here is some water or let take break or even good news ga this place has roof let close it it was instead reminder that players are allowed only second break between points so get back out there afterward djokovic who won the match but looked as haggard and sickly as monfils did said there is limit and that is level of guess tolerance between being fit and being think in danger in terms of health   was right at the limit when you watch two world class professionals barely able to lift their rackets in one of their sport signature events you can help but wonder what exactly we re trying to prove here reason we watch sports is to see the planet most talented dedicated athletes perform at the highest levels to see true physical genius in their chosen pursuits it is not to watch them perform at fraction of their abilities because they can hardly stand there has long been fetishization of athletes being able to withstand the elements to overcome them en route to victory the marathoner who survives degree temperatures the football player who braves frigid weather to win the big game but why to appreciate true genius is to see it uninhibited by exterior circumstances to see it in its purest natural element sports are entertainment and part of that entertainment is to see athletic genius at work why   we want to see wonderful athlete unable to be his or her best because it absurdly hot or cold outside the beauty is in the performance not what surrounds it   you appreciate say daniel day lewis performance more because it was done in storage freezer or in the middle of blazing desert never mind that knowing him he probably still win an oscar isn the art itself enough the has constructed whole cottage industry out of frozen tundra as spectacle all born from the infamous ice bowl of the championship game in which the packers outlasted the cowboys at lambeau field in conditions where the wind chill reached about minus degrees fahrenheit but that game is compelling only as lore in the moment it was virtually unwatchable and barely even resembled football during the game the packers quarterback bart starr got frostbite in his fingers the linebacker ray nitschke frostbite was so awful his toenails fell off the marching band in attendance  n play because the woodwinds froze after whistling for kickoff the referee norm schachter realized that his whistle was stuck to his lips when he tried to remove it the skin ripped from his mouth the refs stopped using their whistles after that and communicated by screaming for play to stop fan in the stands died this was not football this was simply bunch of men trying not to freeze to death and yet the game is still talked about as classic decades later to the detriment not just of the men and women who play but of the pleasure of the fans who watch them weather does not enhance the enjoyment of sports it stands in the way we watch sports to see great quarterback throw perfect pass to win the big game we do not watch the ball hit stiff wind and flutter like wounded duck   anyone want to watch basketball game where jump shots   be blown off course what   that tell us about who was the better team to watch the monfils djokovic match was to watch two men wilting and withering away neither looked like even close to the star tennis players we ve seen them both be for years closing the roof and providing climate controlled environment to play every sport in optimal conditions for athletes to thrive  n just be more humane to the players it   be far more enjoyable to watch we want to see athletes do incredible things that we cannot we do not want to see them

advertisementsupported bynews analysisthe college sports tax dodgeimagecreditmarta monteiroby mike mcintiredec new york university does not have much of an athletic program but years ago it ran profitable macaroni company leading indirectly to decision by congress that college sports if not college owned noodle business should be exempt from taxation   as the hugely lucrative football bowl season wraps up colleges fear that the new tax law signed by president trump   derail their gravy train two provisions target coaches high salaries and booster donations tied to ticket purchases but they need not worry much there are no plans to start taxing television revenue and corporate sponsorships two of the biggest income streams which together transformed intercollegiate athletics into multibillion dollar business even with the legislative changes collegiate sports remain largely tax exempt the beneficiary of public subsidy that is increasingly difficult to defend the corrosive culture of money in big time college sports more than billion year among the national collegiate athletic association division sports programs was painfully obvious recently with the indictments of college coaches and an adidas executive charged with paying bribes to recruit basketball players and steer them to agents it was left to federal prosecutors to issue statement condemning the criminal influence of money on coaches and student athletes the tax exempt nature of college sports is not the cause of these problems rather it is rocket fuel for an engine that has escaped the gravitational pull of common sense and decency to understand how this is possible consider the balance sheet of the atlantic coast conference home of the national champions in football clemson and men basketball north carolina its corporate sponsors include toyota gatorade and geico when the conference filed its annual tax return for it reported about quarter billion dollars from broadcasting games for its member universities as well as million in other sports related revenue its commissioner earned million the was huge commercial success with income that   normally generate huge tax bill but no taxes were owed as the conference explained in its filing with the internal revenue service the atlantic coast and its member schools are nonprofit charitable organizations that place an emphasis on academic excellence the atlantic coast conference it said seeks to maximize the educational and athletic opportunities of its student athletes while enriching their quality of life the magic word here is educational student athletes have always been considered unpaid amateurs engaging in extracurricular activities rather than profitable professions so college sports is deemed part of the educational mission of schools and exempt from income taxes there are specific and contentious interpretations of law that prop up this assumption in the modern era but they have weakened as big time college sports has taken on the trappings of profit driven business far removed from the cloistered groves of academe it is only through decades of aggressive lobbying and legal battles that universities have managed to avoid income taxes on billions of dollars from broadcast rights sponsorships and donations from boosters the seminal moment came in response to an attempt by to extend its tax exempt status to profits generated by mueller company pasta maker that had been donated to its law school in congress took notice and eventually enacted the unrelated business income tax to capture revenue considered ancillary to nonprofit organization mission sensing the threat the pressed lawmakers to make sure that the new tax   not apply to money from school sports programs accordingly congressional committee reports declared that athletic activities of schools are substantially related to their educational functions even citing the supposed educational benefits of football and basketball so an escape hatch was opened for college sports over the years the has periodically tried to close it in the late the agency looked at the relatively new stream of television revenue from college games and considered treating it as taxable unrelated business income this ignited spirited lobbying campaign by colleges and the until the retreated declaring that selling tickets to fans who go to the school stadium was not all that different from broadcasting games to television audience clearly the did not foresee the commercialized power  that college sports   become driven by national television viewership for example in the big east conference first year of operation in it earned for the right to broadcast all of its games three decades later espn   offer more than million for those rights other attempts to tax college sports profits have been mostly rejected by lawmakers in the congress did an end run around the and decreed that corporate sponsorships did not amount to advertising which   be subject to the unrelated business income tax it was not until the recently approved republican tax plan that lawmakers reversed course eliminating partial deduction for booster donations tied to the sale of game tickets and imposing an excise tax on college employee salaries exceeding million over all however most athletics revenue  s to flow tax free that means the college sports machine keeps cranking out expensive entertainment and the scandals that go with it while sheltered by the scholastic equivalent of cayman islands tax dodge if president

creditmike cohen for the  by david gellesfeb one of the nation most powerful black chief executives is breaking his silence after publicly sparring with president trump last year kenneth frazier the chief executive of the pharmaceuticals company merck served on one of mr trump business advisory councils in the early days of the administration but after mr trump equivocated in his response to an outburst of white nationalist violence last august in charlottesville va the advisory groups swiftly unraveled mr frazier the grandson of man born into slavery was the first of series of chief executives to distance themselves from the president feel responsibility to take stand against extremism he wrote on merck twitter account at the time in recent interview with the   mr frazier elaborated for the first time on his motivation for taking stance it was my view that to not take stand on this   be viewed as tacit endorsement of what had happened and what was said he said think words have consequences and think actions have consequences just felt that as matter of my own personal conscience   not remain mr frazier spoke to the   for the corner office column series of interviews with business leaders that was regular feature from until last fall it will return next month with fuller interview with mr frazier in which he covers broad range of topics including his upbringing his early career and merck efforts to fight cancer and other diseases the events that led to mr frazier confrontation with the president unfolded over tense summer weekend as white nationalists gathered in charlottesville to protest the removal of statue of robert lee bloody fighting broke out as they clashed with counterdemonstrators one of whom was killed when self described neo nazi drove his car into crowd of people saw what was happening on that friday night and then heard the horrible news about what had happened on saturday with the young woman being killed and others being run down by person who was sympathetic to people who held views that consider personally noxious mr frazier said and then heard the president response mr trump speaking at veterans event at one of his golf clubs condemned the violence but did not criticize the white nationalists chanting neo nazi slogans he blamed hatred bigotry and violence on many sides on many sides the president remarks drew widespread condemnation for appearing to equate the actions of the counterprotesters with those of neo nazis and many americans including mr frazier found them deeply inadequate in that moment the president response was one that felt was not in concordance with my views mr frazier said and didn think they were in concordance with the views that we claim to hold as country before announcing his decision to resign from the president manufacturing council mr frazier consulted with the merck board wanted to say that this was statement was making in terms of my own values and the company values and there was unanimous support for that he said my board supported that percent then on monday morning merck posted statement from mr frazier on twitter am resigning from the president american manufacturing council it read in part our country strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths races sexual orientations and political beliefs the president not one to let slight go swiftly hit back on twitter now that ken frazier of merck pharma has resigned from president manufacturing council he will have more time to lower ripoff drug prices the president wrote for most of that monday mr frazier was the lonely voice of opposition among business leaders with few chief executives offering their support for him but on monday night the chief executives of intel and under armour also stepped down from the advisory groups by wednesday dozens of the country top chief executives had reached the same conclusion they   no longer be part of the advisory councils the groups were disbanded mr frazier doesn regret his initial decision to advise the president joined because think merck is an important company and has something to contribute to the discussion about how we   as country become much more competitive in the global economy he said joined because the president asked me to join and thought it was the right thing to do as the of company like merck and mr trump remarks after charlottesville were not the first time that mr frazier found himself at odds with the president there were things that happened earlier on in this administration that didn necessarily agree with about immigration and climate change but didn think that it was my role to actually speak out on those issues he said there process for deciding how we address those issues as country this is democracy but he viewed mr trump unwillingness to condemn white nationalists as different in this case we were not talking about politics mr frazier  d we were talking about the basic values of the country mr frazier did not respond to the president tweet and has not spoken publicly about the episode until now for man who rose to the pinnacle of corporate america mr frazier came from humble background his grandfather was born into slavery in south carolina and his father was janitor in philadelphia yet mr frazier parents pushed him to believe he   achieve great things they believed that despite the hi  of this country as it related to african americans that for my siblings and there   be tremendous opportunity he said they also instilled that it was our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities that they did not have mr frazier attended pennsylvania state university after earning degree from harvard law school he went to work at drinker biddle reath law firm in philadelphia while there he began representing merck and took on pro bono work he spent several summers in south africa teaching black law students and he took on the case of james willie cochran known as bo black inmate on death row who had been convicted of killing white store manager after looking at the evidence mr frazier and his colleagues became convinced of mr cochran innocence they eventually secured him new trial and he was acquitted in it was by far the most important thing that ve ever done in my life full stop professionally mr frazier said this is man who was facing an execution date for crime he did not commit mr frazier joined merck and rose through the ranks overseeing the company defense against lawsuits related to the anti inflammatory drug vioxx and as chief executive since making the development of drugs to treat cancer priority in the merck developed treatment for river blindness and opted to give it away many people   say that was the spark for lot of what we call corporate social responsibility mr frazier said early in his tenure as chief executive mr frazier resisted calls to cut research and development spending and focus on profitability we value as company he said it who we are mr frazier has little interest in dwelling on his feud with mr trump and   rather stay out of politics altogether yet when confronted last summer with stance he considered unconscionable mr frazier said he   not help but speak out what happened that weekend think was not democratic issue or republican issue he said think

east river as long and as tall as cruise ship the sleek glass structure loomed above rusty century old dry docks serving notice to the industrial neighborhood that the new economy was coming the project known as dock is the brainchild of wework the fast growing new york start up valued at whopping billion in just eight years wework has built network of shared working spaces around the globe but wework chief executive and co founder adam neumann isn content to just lease out communal offices mr neumann lanky longhaired year old israeli wants nothing less than to radically transform the way we work live and play when dock is completed this year if the aggressive timeline holds it will represent the fullest expression of mr neumann expansive vision to date there will be an enormous co working space luxury spa and large offices for other companies like ibm and verizon that are designed and run by wework there will be juice bar real bar gym with boxing studio an outdoor basketball court and panoramic vistas of manhattan there will be restaurants and maybe even dry cleaning services and barbershop it will be the kind of place you never have to leave until you need to go to sleep and if mr neumann has his way you ll sleep at one of the apartments he is renting nearby it an all encompassing sort of ambition and mr neumann is the brash and idealistic pitchman simply by encouraging strangers to share beer at the office he argues wework can heal our fractured society how do you change the world mr neumann asked in recent interview bring people together where is the easiest big place to bring people together in the work environment imagethe newest wework building now under construction at the brooklyn navy yard when the   building is completed it will represent

founder miguel mckelvey are selling wework has rapidly expanded to countries assembled formidable executive team and attracted some members big companies like jpmorgan chase and siemens are signing on as tenants and revenues are growing fast expected to top billion this year wework last year bought the iconic lord taylor building on fifth avenue in manhattan which is being transformed into the company new headquarters that deal was made possible in part by recent billion investment from softbank the japanese technology group led by the enigmatic billionaire masayoshi son already the company has started welive its residential offering and rise its gym it acquired meetup the social network that facilitates in person gatherings and the flatiron school coding academy still to come wegrow the

instructors architects teachers environmental scientists software engineers molecular biologists and social psychologists is it all bit much for young company still trying to build out its core business ve made that argument said bruce dunlevie wework board member and partner at the venture capital firm benchmark but he said great entrepreneurs like adam don listen to guys like me as wework expands in all directions it faces persistent questions about its rich valuation and the durability of its business model critics argue that the company does little more than corporate real estate arbitrage leasing space spiffing it up then subleasing it out to other tenants the company owns hardly any properties giving it precious few hard assets its growth projections strike many as unattainable and it has missed expectations before number of upstarts loom as potential competitors seeking to replicate wework success and many wework tenants are unproven start ups that   quickly fold iwg publicly traded co working company that has more members and more real estate than wework is valued at just billion yet mr neumann has convinced investors that wework is worth   that figure adam explanation for the valuation of wework speaks for itself said chris kelly co founder and president of convene company that offers flexible event spaces and is backed by major real estate firms this is not an excel spreadsheet calculation he believes there an energy behind the brand and he gotten people to invest at that valuation he has not tried to explain it in traditional financial terms indeed to assess wework by conventional metrics is to miss the point according to mr neumann wework isn really real estate company it state of consciousness he argues generation of interconnected emotionally intelligent entrepreneurs and mr neumann with his combination of inspiration and chutzpah wants to transform not just the way we work and live but the very world we live in image how do you change the world says adam neumann one of the founders of wework bring people together where is the easiest big place to bring people together in the work environment creditpeter prato for the  it an audacious perhaps delusional plan for company that made its mark by building communal desks and providing refreshments and so far it seems to be working mr son wework largest investor is betting that the company will grow exponentially in the years to come making his multibillion dollar investment veritable bargain make it   bigger than your original plan mr son told forbes late last year if you think in that manner the valuation is cheap it can be worth few hundred billion dollars close communitiesthe notion that white collar workers might actually like their offices is relatively new one from the counting s of industrial england to the skyscrapers of manhattan offices were mostly uninspiring places designed to maximize space often with row upon row of unglamorous desks the only kind of model that anyone had for laying out large workplace was factory said nikil saval author of cubed secret hi  of the workplace so the office was made to resemble an assembly line this dreary state of affairs began to change in earnest at least for some during the dot com bubble tech companies built playful offices with beanbags and ping pong tables making work spaces less formal free food became commonplace raised expectations for amenities and interior design gradually seeped into the mainstream and   more and more employees e ly millennials expect enlightened unconventional offices enter wework with people bouncing between employers jobs concentrated in cities and technology making it easier to work remotely the demand for co working was suddenly real and ready to be monetized mr neumann who grew up on kibbutz in israel had an epiphany bring the communal vibe to the office soon he and friend mr mckelvey an equally tall oregonian who grew up on collective and was working as an architect founded an eco friendly co working space in brooklyn they sold it but they quickly turned around and started wework in me and miguel have this common ground mr neumann said we both grew up in very close communities image we only have members says miguel mckelvey the other co founder referring to the people and companies that rent space from wework that ridiculous we need to have two million and then million creditcole wilson for the  wework didn invent co working spaces of course iwg better known as regus has been around for decades but mr neumann and mr mckelvey quickly hit upon recipe that drew throngs of start ups an industrial chic aesthetic some big common areas with comfy couches free beer and piped in pop music individuals pay as little as month for occasional access to desk in common area start ups can pay few thousand dollars for private room on month to month basis and some big companies pay millions of dollars year for spaces that hold thousands of employees over multiple locations it formula that has caught on from new york to tel aviv to shanghai in new york alone wework has spaces most of them nearly full at the wework in harlem dance companies share space with hair care start ups in common area adorned with murals of jazz musicians at wework in tribeca fashion designers and alcohol distributors work shoulder to shoulder in spartan space decorated with neon lighting for wework to really succeed in changing the way we all work it is going to have to win over big corporations seeking space for thousands of employees the strategy is an odd reversal for wework which made its name catering to freelancers and start ups the weather channel recently moved its ad sales team into an enormous wework in midtown manhattan barbara bekkedahl who runs the group said the transition was easy and the space comfortable and stylish but ms bekkedahl had complaint too one that highlights one of the downsides of communal work space she suggested that the hygienic and sartorial habits of some of her new office mates were lacking as tv sales team we groom and dress for outside sales she said some of the techie and start up types  d at wework aren facing customers all day so don always have the same standards gripes about grooming are unlikely to slow down wework business with corporate clients e ly if mr neumann makes good on his promise to save them money because wework is building out so much space and buying so much furniture mr neumann says he can renovate and operate an office for fraction of the cost that companies   normally spend we have economies of scale he said ll cut your operational costs between to percent it might seem like another instance of mr neumann talking big game but for the fact that more and more companies ge hsbc salesforce and microsoft among them are signing on for years now big companies have outsourced payroll processing janitorial services and security it not stretch to imagine more of them outsourcing the design and maintenance of their offices to company like wework we only have members mr mckelvey said that ridiculous we need to have two million and then million more we than me bankers and lawyers poured out of skyscrapers and made for the suburbs on recent monday night in manhattan financial district but at wall street building controlled entirely by wework the party was just getting started last year this era office tower was converted into mixed use development of mr neumann design there is co working space on the ground floor are trendy restaurants including westville fuku momofuku milk bar and bar called the mail room and then there is welive complex of about fully furnished apartments rented out on short term basis tenants get the signature wework aesthetic of unpolished wood and wrought iron as well as various perks there are hot tubs on the terrace there are arcade games and pool table in the laundry room there are chef kitchen and communal dining room at bar on residential floor happy hour was brewing and free tempranillo was flowing in the communal dining area three brothers jordan jake and jimmy decicco were cooking for half dozen social media influencers hoping to stir up enthusiasm for their protein infused iced coffee company over rib eye steaks and brussels sprouts they talked about promoting the brand and breaking into new markets passing out beers to anyone who walked by imagethe rise gym in the wework occupied building at broad street in downtown manhattan creditcole wilson for the  imagethe spa area at broad street creditcole wilson for the  imagethe laundry room at welive at wall street includes pool table and arcade games the wework founders conceived an office environment that quickly drew throngs of start ups an industrial chic aesthetic some big common areas with comfy couches free beer and piped in pop music creditcole wilson for the  the brothers are all in they live in welive work in the adjacent wework space and exercise at wework nearby gym rise it awesome jake decicco said you just roll out of bed go down the elevator and get to work had mr neumann been there to share beer those words   have been music to his ears he believes that creating work and living environment where people mingle is in fact world changing innovation each wework has community manager who keeps tabs on members makes introductions and organizes social activities if more strangers are colliding by the grapefruit water the thinking goes they are more likely to meet up and invest in one another socially responsible start ups and then the world will be better place once you choose to enter wework you choose to be part of something more we than me mr neumann said people start coming together they ll see each other in the elevator they talk in the stairways there thousand other things they do elevators stairways hardly world changing innovations but wework takes extra steps to encourage fraternization like beer kegs that never run dry more than most companies wework promotes the consumption of alcohol as an inherent virtue posters on the wall encourage people to have drink there are wine tastings at welive company parties feature top shelf liquor mr neumann has well known penchant for tequila and well stocked bar is prominent in his office on recent tuesday at the community manager of wework in midtown manhattan sent an email   it time to get your creative juices flowing join us on the th floor to drink some wine paint beautiful picture just after noon on valentine day there was an invitation to share wine and cake in the common area though alcohol is social lubricant for some it can be off putting to many others many women have shared stories of feeling uncomfortable with what they described as frat   culture at some weworks prompting some to leave as wework has grown minor scandals have rattled the company in the company grew ensnared in complicated legal dispute with group of former janitors who tried to unionize at subcontractor that wework used the next year wework drew scrutiny for its use of arbitration to settle workplace disputes and for its firing of an employee who refused to adhere to related policy but so far nothing not alcohol labor disputes questions about the business fundamentals or bad publicity has managed to alter the company trajectory we re disrupter of the way people view the spaces they work in on day to day basis said mr dunlevie of benchmark and we re in the early days of taking advantage of that phenomenon teaching tykesin september wework will open its most ambitious project to date kindergarten it may also be the effort that tests whether wework is flying too close to the sun the creation of mr neumann wife rebekah the school is known as wegrow when it opens it promises well designed space with curriculum that emphasizes socializing and entrepreneurship for year olds on up wegrow fits neatly into mr neumann expansive vision for creating generation of empathetic social impact entrepreneurs but the risk reward calculus is different when starting school wegrow won scale as rapidly as wework has so the financial upside is limited yet should something go wrong the fallout   be devastating it one thing to be responsible for the internet going out or paper running low at the communal printer it another thing to take responsibility for the health and development of someone child imageaspirations for the coming year were recently posted in the hallway of rise gym creditcole wilson for the  though ms neumann has no background in education on the website she describes herself as an avid student of life and says her superpower is intuition she has applied for accreditation from the state has hired team of career educators and is accepting applications for the coming school year tuition for toddlers year we all understand how complicated and regulated school is compared to the simpler business that we are already in mr neumann said but we decided we re going to go into education if you really want to change the world change kids when they re as he proselytized mr neumann was sitting on an enormous leather couch in his chelsea office which is bigger than many new york city apartments it included conference table video conferencing setup several desks bar spreads of food peloton exercise bike climbing machine boxing bag hanging from the ceiling gong an antechamber where assistants work and private bathroom it going to work mr neumann  d is it going to be perfect definitely not are we going to make mistakes hundred percent are we going to be comfortable admitting those mistakes definitely it what we do here though such unbridled zeal can be abrasive to some it   also be viewed as the mark of peripatetic savant walter isaacson the biographer of steve jobs albert einstein benjamin franklin and leonardo da vinci counts mr neumann as friend and said he shared some of the attributes that had allowed those other titans to succeed he has an instinctive feel for how millennials are going to want to have community work experiences without joining large corporations mr isaacson said and like steve jobs and other great entrepreneurs he knows how to connect the humanities with business and technology make life it can be tempting to dismiss wework as just another overvalued start up that is high on its own rhetoric and flush with easy money from na ve investors with little more than faddish interior design free beer and an invitation to socialize with strangers mr neumann claims to have conjured up whole new paradigm for white collar workers and for education and vows that it can change the world it the kind of utopian prattle that can come off as dangerously out of touch at moment when backlash against big tech is brewing but if any of these potential pitfalls concern mr neumann he doesn show it on wednesday night in january mr neumann

performer the grammy winning rapper macklemore waited backstage mr neumann went on an impromptu riff about how people should make life not just living the company aspirational motto mr neumann also

hundreds of knowing employees in the room mr son whose nickname is masa was conveniently absent but it was tell from mr neumann sly admission that at this point he is playing with   money then when

rodgers in credit image from unmasked unmasked by andrew lloyd webber illustrated pp harper harpercollins publishers until recently   have said the three most painful hours spent in broadway theater in were the ones watching glenn close gamely rasp her way through the lugubrious revival of sunset boulevard andrew lloyd webber musical version of the classic billy wilder movie close had starred in the original broadway production years earlier and time had not been kind to either her singing voice or the show itself but then on the second to last day of the year went to matinee of the recent revival of cats also by lloyd webber ending its year and half run that night the original broadway production of cats ran for years making it the longest running musical in broadway hi  until it was eclipsed by the still running phantom of the opera written by who else andrew lloyd webber surrounded by enthusiastic fans some of whom had come in costume sat through the frantically charmless first act before bolting for the exit at intermission at least got to hear memory so perhaps am not the ideal reader for lloyd webber memoir unmasked the first of what the composer suggests will be two volumes but as someone who has long been devoted theatergoer and can knowledgeably debate for instance the finer points of the angela lansbury versus tyne daly versus bernadette peters productions of gypsy have grudging admiration for someone who once had four shows running simultaneously on broadway tying record that had been held by the legendary rodgers and hammerstein and the original cast album of lloyd webber jesus christ superstar was certainly in heavy rotation during my youth as was its hit single don know how to love him moreover lloyd webber has worked over the years with some of the most compelling characters in musical theater among them harold prince patti lupone and cameron mackintosh and was hoping for some good dish particularly on lupone the evita star with whom lloyd webber later had famous feud after he fired her from the broadway production of sunset boulevard and replaced her with close but alas lloyd webber doesn appear to be much interested in dishing the dirt in this volume at least not in the tradition of most kiss and tell theatrical memoirs including lupone own which doesn shy away from naming names and settling scores lupone spends two full chapters bitterly recounting the sunset boulevard tale and lloyd webber points out that she once said evita was clearly written by composer who hates women advertisement     the main   in his preface lloyd webber implies that some readers may find his book lacking in dramatic narrative autobiographies are by definition self serving and mine is no exception he says adding he was pressured to write it by friends and literary agent and finally agreed primarily to shut them up     the main   advertisement     the main   not exactly the promise of page turner to come still he soldiers on and so must andrew lloyd webber who turns   was born in london westminster hospital to father who was talented but unambitious composer who turned instead to the academic world and mother who poured her own dreams into andrew and his younger brother   from the beginning lloyd webber showed distinct musical talent and he was an early fan of musical theater seeing the london productions of my fair lady and west side   while still child beginning to write school theatricals when he was and finding that his satirical portraits of the teachers suddenly made him popular with his peers boys were shouting lloydy lloydy he recalls the turning point in his career came in when he met tim rice whom his agent had recommended as potential lyricist for project the precocious year old was beginning to work on the meeting seemed to go well awe struck might be better way of describing my first encounter with timothy miles bindon rice lloyd webber says the two later went on to write joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat jesus christ superstar and evita parting ways around the time that cats was coming together as lyricist rice was replaced by long dead eliot one recurring theme of lloyd webber memoir is his increasingly fractious relationship with rice the two seem to have fallen out sometime around evita their collaboration apparently complicated by rice affair with elaine paige the leading lady in the original london production and by tensions over which of the two men was getting more credit for their growing fame final break came when rice was called in on cats to help write the lyrics for what   eventually become memory but his work never made it into the final product we had great years rice later told an interviewer very few artistic partnerships last more than years

subscribed to this email view all   newsletters see sample manage email preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime lloyd webber frequently drops hints that all was not well between the two at one point quoting his father saying you won have long term partnership with tim but he never states what exactly went wrong or demonstrates that he ever confronted rice about what he apparently saw as his undermining and occasionally deceitful ways the closest he comes is when he seems to suspect that rice was trying to undercut the forthcoming production of phantom by attempting to hijack its director hal prince for show of his own the other main character in lloyd webber life at least in the period covered in this book is the singer sarah brightman his second wife with whom he had an affair while still married to his first wife also named sarah and whom he later cast in the phantom of the opera even if you knew nothing of lloyd webber personal life and that this union did not last the author certainly foreshadows the fact that the marriage was doomed while describing her otherworldly singing voice and delicate beauty lloyd webber casually says that during their affair brightman was married to man no one ever seems to have seen and insinuates that she had reputation for becoming romantically entangled with colleagues sure enough when their split finally comes lloyd webber mentions in passing that brightman was apparently having an affair with keyboard player in the phantom orchestra lloyd webber seems to have found marital bliss with his third wife madeleine to whom he has been married for years the one revelation in the book has nothing to do with lloyd webber music or his romantic affairs it is the surprising assertion that in milos forman approached him about playing mozart in his film version of amadeus lloyd webber was appalled telling forman that he was hopeless actor but the director was undeterred you are hotheaded perfectionist who can be extremely obnoxious lloyd webber quotes him saying want you to play yourself lloyd webber writes that forman pursued him off and on for the next couple of years and that he managed to wriggle out of the director grasp only when he insisted jokingly he says in meeting with forman and some of the producers that mozart music be replaced by his own startlingly the producers seemed willing to go along until forman stepped in and stated the obvious think andrew is saying he doesn want to play the role the film with tom hulce taking on the role of mozart went on to win eight oscars my suspicion is that lloyd webber might have had similar conversation with his book editor arguing that he really didn want to write memoir if so readers may finish this book wishing the

advertisementopinionsupported byop ed contributora killing in saskatchewanby gabrielle scrimshawfeb imagecreditpatrick kylelast friday jury in battleford saskatchewan found gerald stanley not guilty of second degree murder mr stanley farmer had killed colten boushie year old indigenous man who he believed was trying to rob him mr boushie was shot in the head while sitting in the back seat of parked vehicle no one denies that gerald stanley shot colten boushie the problem for many canadians is mr stanley claim that mr boushie death was an accident the all white jury agreed with mr stanley defense even dismissing the lesser charge of manslaughter the verdict prompted huge outcry last weekend thousands marched in rallies across canada with indigenous activists pointing to the systemic racism in the justice system the conduct of the royal canadian mounted police officers who investigated the shooting and the legal process itself have come under intense scrutiny alvin baptiste mr boushie uncle said the authorities treated the family as though they did something wrong and in the run up to mr stanley two week trial the defense excluded five potential jurors who were visibly indigenous in response to complaints the police admitted that their actions   have been perceived as insensitive and the government plans to review the jury selection process while on tour in california prime minister justin trudeau acknowledged the grief of mr boushie family stating he was sending love from the united states later he added there are systemic issues in our criminal justice system that we must address and this week he met with mr boushie family for many indigenous people the verdict in the boushie murder trial is part of cycle of government apologies and tears followed by limited progress on achieving equality for indigenous people if canada is to mend its systemic inequalities it needs to first address its problem with racism national truth and reconciliation commission reported in that canada committed cultural genocide against indigenous people through long term government policy including separating children from their families forced migration and outlawing language and cultural practices the intergenerational trauma wrought by these policies has left indigenous people at the bottom of nearly every social and economic indicator suicide rates for indigenous youth are among the highest in the world indigenous people are   more likely to be incarcerated nearly twice as likely to be unemployed and can be up to three   as likely to experience food insecurity in saskatchewan large agricultural province with just over one million people one in residents identifies as indigenous the province had the second largest number of indian residential schools in canada the government funded church run schools that forcibly took generations of indigenous children from their communities in an attempt to assimilate them into white society thousands of children perished while attending these schools and the physical mental and sexual abuse many endured is well documented in saskatchewan tensions between indigenous and non indigenous people run several generations deep yet for many people in canada the reaction to the boushie verdict has come as surprise study in found that canadians have only recently begun to understand the discrimination faced by indigenous people and many feel it is no different from that faced by other minority populations in the country this can be explained partly by an urban rural divide eighty percent of canadians live in cities and half of indigenous people reside in rural areas leaving many urbanites unaware of the systemic and longstanding racism plaguing indigenous people but if you look beyond the urban enclaves to canada rural backyard you see more complete picture grew up in small saskatchewan town two hours east of where mr boushie was killed as dene girl of was accused of stealing while was browsing the aisles of girls accessories store was when friend cree hockey player said white man spat on him during game when was in college young man whose father brother and uncle were members of the royal canadian mounted police declared one night that he wanted to be police officer so that he   shoot some indians was young trying to make friends and didn challenge the comment later when mentioned the incident to person there that evening he told me that the comment wasn about race but the fact that natives just commit more crime failing to call out racism makes it easier for people to believe there isn any worse yet racism becomes so acceptable we stop being able to recognize it in november major political candidate said that when he was growing up in saskatchewan he didn even know that racism existed it took me years to find the courage to call out racism when see it canada doesn have that long one in three indigenous people is under the age of and these young people are growing up facing discrimination at every turn while canadians debate the role of racism in the boushie trial and verdict indigenous people are losing faith in the justice system the government and the idea of reconciliation canadians need to absorb the century long hi  of systemic racism that led to colten boushie killing   the findings from the truth and reconciliation commission final report   be good start until our leaders and regular canadians state plainly that canada has problem with racism indigenous people will   to have their lives cut short gabrielle scrimshaw joint degree

benchmark but he said great entrepreneurs like adam don listen to guys like me as wework expands in all directions it faces persistent questions about its rich valuation and the durability of its business model critics argue that the company does little more than corporate real estate arbitrage leasing space spiffing it up then subleasing it out to other tenants the company owns hardly any properties giving it precious few hard assets its growth projections strike many as unattainable and it has missed expectations before number of upstarts loom as potential competitors seeking to replicate wework success and many wework tenants are unproven start ups that   quickly fold iwg publicly traded co working company that has more members and more real estate than wework is valued at just billion yet mr neumann has convinced investors that wework is worth   that figure adam explanation for the valuation of wework speaks for itself said chris kelly co founder and president of convene company that offers flexible event spaces and is backed by major real estate firms this is not an excel spreadsheet calculation he believes there an energy behind the brand and he gotten people to invest at that valuation he has not tried to explain it in traditional financial terms indeed to assess wework by conventional metrics is to miss the point according to mr neumann wework isn

refreshments and so far it seems to be working advertisement     the main   mr son wework largest investor is betting that the company will grow exponentially in the years to come making his multibillion dollar investment veritable bargain make it   bigger than your original plan mr son told forbes late last year if you think in that manner the valuation is cheap it can be worth few hundred billion dollars close communitiesthe notion that white collar workers might actually like their offices is relatively new one from the counting s of industrial england to the skyscrapers of manhattan offices were mostly uninspiring places designed to maximize space often with row upon row of unglamorous desks the only kind of model that anyone had for laying out large workplace was factory said nikil saval author of cubed secret hi  of the workplace so the office was made to resemble an assembly line this dreary state of affairs began to change in earnest at least for some during the dot com bubble tech companies built playful offices with beanbags and ping pong tables making work spaces less formal free food became commonplace raised expectations for amenities and interior design gradually seeped into the mainstream and   more and more employees e ly millennials expect enlightened unconventional offices enter wework with people bouncing between employers jobs concentrated in cities and technology making it easier to work remotely the demand for co working was suddenly real and ready to be monetized mr neumann who grew up on kibbutz in israel had an

common area start ups can pay few thousand dollars for private room on month to month basis and some big companies pay millions of dollars year for spaces that hold thousands of employees over

with hair care start ups in common area adorned with murals of jazz musicians at wework in tribeca fashion designers and alcohol distributors work shoulder to shoulder in spartan space decorated with neon lighting for wework to really succeed in changing the way we all work it is going to have to win over big corporations seeking space for thousands of employees the strategy is an odd reversal for wework which made its name catering to freelancers and start ups the weather channel recently moved its ad sales team into an enormous wework in midtown manhattan barbara bekkedahl who runs the group said the transition was easy and the space comfortable and stylish but ms bekkedahl had complaint too one that highlights one of the downsides of communal work space she suggested that the hygienic

at wework aren facing customers all day so don always have the same standards gripes about grooming are unlikely to slow down wework business with corporate clients e ly if mr neumann makes good on his promise to save them money because wework is building out so much space and buying so much furniture mr neumann says he can renovate and operate an office for fraction of the cost that companies   normally spend we have economies of scale he said ll cut your operational costs between to percent it might seem like another instance of mr neumann talking big game but for the fact that more and

customers all day so don always have the same standards gripes about grooming are unlikely to slow down wework business with corporate clients e ly if mr neumann makes good on his promise to save them money because wework is building out so much space and buying so much furniture mr neumann says he can renovate and operate an office for fraction of the cost that companies   normally spend we have economies of scale he said ll cut your operational costs between to percent it might seem like another instance of mr neumann talking big game but for the fact that more and more companies ge hsbc salesforce and microsoft among them are signing on for years now big companies have outsourced payroll processing janitorial services and security it not stretch to imagine more of them outsourcing

have been music to his ears he believes that creating work and living environment where people mingle is in fact world changing innovation each wework has community manager who keeps tabs on members makes introductions and organizes social activities if more strangers are colliding by the grapefruit water the thinking goes they are more likely to meet up and invest in one another socially responsible start ups and then the world will be better place once you choose to enter wework you choose to be part of something more we than me mr neumann said people start coming together they ll see each other in the elevator they talk in the stairways there thousand other things they do elevators stairways hardly world changing innovations but wework takes extra steps to encourage fraternization like beer kegs that never run dry more than most companies wework promotes the consumption of alcohol as an inherent virtue posters on the wall encourage people to have drink there are

legal dispute with group of former janitors who tried to unionize at subcontractor that wework used the next year wework drew scrutiny for its use of arbitration to settle workplace disputes and for its firing of an employee who refused to adhere to related policy but so far nothing not alcohol labor disputes questions about the business fundamentals or bad publicity has managed to alter the company trajectory we re disrupter of the way people view the spaces they work in on day to day basis said mr dunlevie of benchmark and we re in the early days of taking advantage of that phenomenon teaching tykesin september wework will open its most ambitious project to date kindergarten it may also be the effort that tests whether wework is flying too close to the sun the creation of mr neumann wife rebekah the school is known as wegrow when it opens it promises well designed space with curriculum that emphasizes socializing and entrepreneurship for year olds on up wegrow fits neatly into mr neumann expansive vision for creating generation of empathetic social impact entrepreneurs but the risk reward calculus is different when starting school wegrow won scale as rapidly as wework

  also be viewed as the mark of peripatetic savant walter isaacson the biographer of steve jobs albert einstein benjamin franklin and leonardo da vinci counts mr neumann as friend and said he shared some of the attributes that had allowed those other titans to succeed he has an instinctive feel for how millennials are going to want to have community work experiences without joining large corporations mr isaacson said and like steve jobs and other great entrepreneurs he knows how to connect the humanities with business and technology make life it can be tempting to dismiss wework as just another overvalued start up that is high on its own rhetoric and flush with easy money from na ve investors with little more than faddish interior design free beer and an invitation to socialize with strangers mr neumann claims to have conjured up whole new paradigm for white collar workers and for education and vows that it can change the world it the kind of utopian prattle that can come

advertisementsupported bythe who stood up to president trump ken frazier speaks outimagekenneth frazier the chief executive of merck speaking at the company headquarters in kenilworth last week creditmike cohen for the  by david gellesfeb one of the nation most powerful black chief executives is breaking his silence after publicly sparring with president trump last year kenneth frazier the chief executive of the pharmaceuticals company merck served on one of mr trump business advisory councils in the early days of the administration but after mr trump equivocated in his response to an outburst of white nationalist violence last august in charlottesville va the advisory groups swiftly unraveled mr frazier the grandson of man born into slavery was the first of series of chief executives to distance themselves from the president feel responsibility to take stand against extremism he wrote on merck twitter account at the time in recent interview with the   mr frazier elaborated for the first time on his motivation for taking stance it was my view that to not take stand on this   be viewed as tacit endorsement of what had happened and what was said he said think words have consequences and think actions have consequences just felt that as matter of my own personal conscience   not remain mr frazier spoke to the   for the corner office column series of interviews with business leaders that was regular feature from until last fall it will return next month with fuller interview with mr frazier in which he covers broad range of topics including his upbringing his early career and merck efforts to fight cancer and other diseases the events that led to mr frazier confrontation with the president unfolded over tense summer weekend as white nationalists gathered in charlottesville to protest the removal of statue of robert lee bloody fighting broke out as they clashed with counterdemonstrators one of whom was killed when self described neo nazi drove his car into crowd of people saw what was happening on that friday night and then heard the horrible news about what had happened on saturday with the young woman being killed and others being run down by person who was sympathetic to people who held views that consider personally noxious mr frazier said and then heard the president response mr trump speaking at veterans event at one of his golf clubs condemned the violence but did not criticize the white nationalists chanting neo nazi slogans he blamed hatred bigotry and violence on many sides on many sides the president remarks drew widespread condemnation for appearing to equate the actions of the counterprotesters with those of neo nazis and many americans including mr frazier found them deeply inadequate in that moment the president response was one that felt was not in concordance with my views mr frazier said and didn think they were in concordance with the views that we claim to hold as country before announcing his decision to resign from the president manufacturing council mr frazier consulted with the merck board wanted to say that this was statement was making in terms of my own values and the company values and there was unanimous support for that he said my board supported that percent then on monday morning merck posted statement from mr frazier on twitter am resigning from the president american manufacturing council it read in part our country strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths races sexual orientations and political beliefs the president not one to let slight go swiftly hit back on twitter now that ken frazier of merck pharma has resigned from president manufacturing council he will have more time to lower ripoff drug prices the president wrote for most of that monday mr frazier was the lonely voice of opposition among business leaders with few chief executives offering their support for him but on monday night the chief executives of intel and under armour also stepped down from the advisory groups by wednesday dozens of the country top chief executives had reached the same conclusion they   no longer be part of the advisory councils the groups were disbanded mr frazier doesn regret his initial decision to advise the president joined because think merck is an important company and has something to contribute to the discussion about how we   as country become much more competitive in the global economy he said joined because the president asked me to join and thought it was the right thing to do as the of company like merck and mr trump remarks after charlottesville were not the first time that mr frazier found himself at odds with the president there were things that happened earlier on in this administration that didn necessarily agree with about immigration and climate change but didn think that it was my role to actually speak out on those issues he said there process for deciding how we address those issues as country this is democracy but he viewed mr trump unwillingness to condemn white nationalists as different in this case we were not talking about politics mr frazier  d we were talking about the basic values of the country mr frazier did not respond to the president tweet and has not spoken publicly about the episode until now for man who rose to the pinnacle of corporate america mr frazier came from humble background his grandfather was born into slavery in south carolina and his father was janitor in philadelphia yet mr frazier parents pushed him to believe he   achieve great things they believed that despite the hi  of this country as it related to african americans that for my siblings and there   be tremendous opportunity he said they also instilled that it was our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities that they did not have mr frazier attended pennsylvania state university after earning degree from harvard law school he went to work at drinker biddle reath law firm in philadelphia while there he began representing merck and took on pro bono work he spent several summers in south africa teaching black law students and he took on the case of james willie cochran known as bo black inmate on death row who had been convicted of killing white store manager after looking at the evidence mr frazier and his colleagues became convinced of mr cochran innocence they eventually secured him new trial and he was acquitted in it was by far the most important thing that ve ever done in my life full stop professionally mr frazier said this is man who was facing an execution date for crime he did not commit mr frazier joined merck and rose through the ranks overseeing the company defense against lawsuits related to the anti inflammatory drug vioxx and as chief executive since making the development of drugs to treat cancer priority in the merck developed treatment for river blindness and opted to give it away many people   say that was the spark for lot of what we call corporate social responsibility mr frazier said early in his tenure as chief executive mr frazier resisted calls to cut research and development spending and focus on profitability we value as company he said it who we are mr frazier has little interest in dwelling on his feud with mr trump and   rather stay out of politics altogether yet when confronted last summer with stance he considered unconscionable mr frazier said he   not help but speak out what happened that weekend think was not democratic issue or republican issue he said think

booksellersbarnes and noblewhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site we earn an affiliate commission by stuart emmrichmarch unmasked by andrew lloyd webber illustrated pp harper harpercollins publishers until recently   have said the three most painful hours spent in broadway theater in were the ones watching glenn close gamely rasp her way through the lugubrious revival of sunset boulevard andrew lloyd webber musical version of the classic billy wilder movie close had starred in the original broadway production years earlier and time had not been kind to either her singing voice or the show itself but then on the second to last day of the year went to matinee of the recent revival of cats also by lloyd webber ending its year and half run that night the original broadway production of cats ran for years making it the longest running musical in broadway hi  until it was eclipsed by the still running phantom of the opera written by who else andrew lloyd webber surrounded by enthusiastic fans some of whom had come in costume sat through the frantically charmless first act before bolting for the exit at intermission at least got to hear memory so perhaps am not the ideal reader for lloyd webber memoir unmasked the first of what the composer suggests will be two volumes but as someone who has long been devoted theatergoer and can knowledgeably debate for instance the finer points of the angela lansbury versus tyne daly versus bernadette peters productions of gypsy have grudging admiration for someone who once had four shows running simultaneously on broadway tying record that had been held by the legendary rodgers and hammerstein and the original cast album of lloyd webber jesus christ superstar was certainly in heavy rotation during my youth as was its hit single don know how to love him moreover lloyd webber has worked over the years with some of the most compelling characters in musical theater among them harold prince patti lupone and cameron mackintosh and was hoping for some good dish particularly on lupone the evita star with whom lloyd webber later had famous feud after he fired her from the broadway production of sunset boulevard and replaced her with close but alas lloyd webber doesn appear to be much interested in dishing the dirt in this volume at least not in the tradition of most kiss and tell theatrical memoirs including lupone own which doesn shy away from naming names and settling scores lupone spends two full chapters bitterly recounting the sunset boulevard tale and lloyd webber points out that she once said evita was clearly written by composer who hates women in his preface lloyd webber implies that some readers may find his book lacking in dramatic narrative autobiographies are by definition self serving and mine is no exception he says adding he was pressured to write it by friends and literary agent and finally agreed primarily to shut them up not exactly the promise of page turner to come still he soldiers on and so must andrew lloyd webber who turns   was born in london westminster hospital to father who was talented but unambitious composer who turned instead to the academic world and mother who poured her own dreams into andrew and his younger brother imagefrom the beginning lloyd webber showed distinct musical talent and he was an early fan of musical theater seeing the london productions of my fair lady and west side   while still child beginning to write school theatricals when he was and finding that his satirical portraits of the teachers suddenly made him popular with his peers boys were shouting lloydy lloydy he recalls the turning point in his career came in when he met tim rice whom his agent had recommended as potential lyricist for project the precocious year old was beginning to work on the meeting seemed to go well awe struck might be better way of describing my first encounter with timothy miles bindon rice lloyd webber says the two later went on to write joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat jesus christ superstar and evita parting ways around the time that cats was coming together as lyricist rice was replaced by long dead eliot one recurring theme of lloyd webber memoir is his increasingly fractious relationship with rice the two seem to have fallen out sometime around evita their collaboration apparently complicated by rice affair with elaine paige the leading lady in the original london production and by tensions over which of the two men was getting more credit for their growing fame final break came when rice was called in on cats to help write the lyrics for what   eventually become memory but his work never made it into the final product we had great years rice later told an interviewer very few artistic partnerships last more than years and if they do they tend to go down the tubes lloyd webber frequently drops hints that all was not well between the two at one point quoting his father saying you won have long term partnership with tim but he never states what exactly went wrong or demonstrates that he ever confronted rice about what he apparently saw as his undermining and occasionally deceitful ways the closest he comes is when he seems to suspect that rice was trying to undercut the forthcoming production of phantom by attempting to hijack its director hal prince for show of his own the other main character in lloyd webber life at least in the period covered in this book is the singer sarah brightman his second wife with whom he had an affair while still married to his first wife also named sarah and whom he later cast in the phantom of the opera even if you knew nothing of lloyd webber personal life and that this union did not last the author certainly foreshadows the fact that the marriage was doomed while describing her otherworldly singing voice and delicate beauty lloyd webber casually says that during their affair brightman was married to man no one ever seems to have seen and insinuates that she had reputation for becoming romantically entangled with colleagues sure enough when their split finally comes lloyd webber mentions in passing that brightman was apparently having an affair with keyboard player in the phantom orchestra lloyd webber seems to have found marital bliss with his third wife madeleine to whom he has been married for years the one revelation in the book has nothing to do with lloyd webber music or his romantic affairs it is the surprising assertion that in milos forman approached him about playing mozart in his film version of amadeus lloyd webber was appalled telling forman that he was hopeless actor but the director was undeterred you are hotheaded perfectionist who can be extremely obnoxious lloyd webber quotes him saying want you to play yourself lloyd webber writes that forman pursued him off and on for the next couple of years and that he managed to wriggle out of the director grasp only when he insisted jokingly he says in meeting with forman and some of the producers that mozart music be replaced by his own startlingly the producers seemed willing to go along until forman stepped in and stated the obvious think andrew is saying he doesn want to play the role the film with tom hulce taking on the role of mozart went on to win eight oscars my suspicion is that lloyd webber might have had similar conversation with his book editor arguing that he really didn want to write memoir if so readers may finish this book wishing the editor had agreed stuart

advertisementopinionsupported byop ed contributora killing in saskatchewanby gabrielle scrimshawfeb imagecreditpatrick kylelast friday jury in battleford saskatchewan found gerald stanley not guilty of second degree murder mr stanley farmer had killed colten boushie year old indigenous man who he believed was trying to rob him mr boushie was shot in the head while sitting in the back seat of parked vehicle no one denies that gerald stanley shot colten boushie the problem for many canadians is mr stanley claim that mr boushie death was an accident the all white jury agreed with mr stanley defense even dismissing the lesser charge of manslaughter the verdict prompted huge outcry last weekend thousands marched in rallies across canada with indigenous activists pointing to the systemic racism in the justice system the conduct of the royal canadian mounted police officers who investigated the shooting and the legal process itself have come under intense scrutiny alvin baptiste mr boushie uncle said the authorities treated the family as though they did something wrong and in the run up to mr stanley two week trial the defense excluded five potential jurors who were visibly indigenous in response to complaints the police admitted that their actions   have been perceived as insensitive and the government plans to review the jury selection process while on tour in california prime minister justin trudeau acknowledged the grief of mr boushie family stating he was sending love from the united states later he added there are systemic issues in our criminal justice system that we must address and this week he met with mr boushie family for many indigenous people the verdict in the boushie murder trial is part of cycle of government apologies and tears followed by limited progress on achieving equality for indigenous people if canada is to mend its systemic inequalities it needs to first address its problem with racism national truth and reconciliation commission reported in that canada committed cultural genocide against indigenous people through long term government policy including separating children from their families forced migration and outlawing language and cultural practices the intergenerational trauma wrought by these policies has left indigenous people at the bottom of nearly every social and economic indicator suicide rates for indigenous youth are among the highest in the world indigenous people are   more likely to be incarcerated nearly twice as likely to be unemployed and can be up to three   as likely to experience food insecurity in saskatchewan large agricultural province with just over one million people one in residents identifies as indigenous the province had the second largest number of indian residential schools in canada the government funded church run schools that forcibly took generations of indigenous children from their communities in an attempt to assimilate them into white society thousands of children perished while attending these schools and the physical mental and sexual abuse many endured is well documented in saskatchewan tensions between indigenous and non indigenous people run several generations deep yet for many people in canada the reaction to the boushie verdict has come as surprise study in found that canadians have only recently begun to understand the discrimination faced by indigenous people and many feel it is no different from that faced by other minority populations in the country this can be explained partly by an urban rural divide eighty percent of canadians live in cities and half of indigenous people reside in rural areas leaving many urbanites unaware of the systemic and longstanding racism plaguing indigenous people but if you look beyond the urban enclaves to canada rural backyard you see more complete picture grew up in small saskatchewan town two hours east of where mr boushie was killed as dene girl of was accused of stealing while was browsing the aisles of girls accessories store was when friend cree hockey player said white man spat on him during game when was in college young man whose father brother and uncle were members of the royal canadian mounted police declared one night that he wanted to be police officer so that he   shoot some indians was young trying to make friends and didn challenge the comment later when mentioned the incident to person there that evening he told me that the comment wasn about race but the fact that natives just commit more crime failing to call out racism makes it easier for people to believe there isn any worse yet racism becomes so acceptable we stop being able to recognize it in november major political candidate said that when he was growing up in saskatchewan he didn even know that racism existed it took me years to find the courage to call out racism when see it canada doesn have that long one in three indigenous people is under the age of and these young people are growing up facing discrimination at every turn while canadians debate the role of racism in the boushie trial and verdict indigenous people are losing faith in the justice system the government and the idea of reconciliation canadians need to absorb the century long hi  of systemic racism that led to colten boushie killing   the findings from the truth and reconciliation commission final report   be good start until our leaders and regular canadians state plainly that canada has problem with racism indigenous people will   to have their lives cut short gabrielle scrimshaw joint degree

mass shootings the chief executive edward stack said that the company was going to take stand and step up and tell people our view and hopefully bring people along into the conversation less than hours later walmart joined dick in raising the age limit on firearm sales walmart stopped selling ar years ago they exemplify recent phenomenon activism in which corporations and their chief

likely to buy apple products after hearing tim cook statement opposing indiana religious freedom bill but other firms have faced angry consumers and had to retrench as target did when hundreds of

automatic rejection of members of the opposing party are infecting our society there will be rash of news stories about increased sales from liberal consumers rushing into dick stores to vote with their wallets conservative media will point to boycotts and highlight other retailers that are stepping in to serve disaffected consumers but the real   will be the long game activism represents historic shift in the way corporations intersect with national politics rather than chief executives shaping political discourse however our toxic political environment is dictating corporate strategy instead of being cast as practical technocrats who   unite us chief executives will be swept up in our cultural war just like university presidents celebrities professional athletes and religious leaders before them brands are likely to become even more segmented into red and blue strengthening the association between liberals and priuses and conservatives and cracker barrel corporate brand

campaigns there will be many more as more companies take stands those remaining will be named and shamed on social media creating impossible choices in an environment where neutrality is not an option like our politicians corporate chiefs will have to quickly figure out what stand they should take on the issue of the day by reflecting on their core convictions and estimating how their customer base will react like pollsters they will have to assess which kind of consumers they can write off and which ones to curry favor with the right answer will vary by company geographic location who their employees are and how much they depend on favorable government regulation there is no going back lists are being kept and wins are being tallied by pressure groups aiming to get companies on their

for corporate executives credittom brenner the  by david gelles and kate kellymarch from the outset gary cohn was an unconventional choice to be president trump top economic adviser former goldman sachs president and proponent of free trade mr cohn had pedigree and economic views that clashed with mr trump populist rhetoric and protectionist policies his methodical approach also contrasted with the president freewheeling style but mr cohn who said on tuesday that he   resign as director of the national economic council brought to the trump administration something that the president himself lacked the widespread respect of top corporate executives now those business leaders are lamenting the loss of one of their own from what is among the country most important economic positions gary brought strong growth orientation for the economy and very balanced perspective particularly on critical topics like trade said rich lesser chief executive of the boston consulting group who served on one of mr trump business advisory panels last year and attended policy meetings with mr cohn he ll be missed mr cohn was instrumental in putting together the sweeping tax law that was enacted last year legislation that delivered windfall to corporations and was the main policy achievement of mr trump first year in office he is leaving the white   just as the president is proposing to impose stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum which mr cohn and many of his business allies strongly oppose it pity we re losing gary this moment said andrew liveris the executive chairman of dowdupont

trump equivocal response to white nationalist violence in charlottesville va stock prices fell before an administration spokesman said that mr cohn planned to stay on tuesday news of his resignation helped send stock futures down in early trading on wednesday the standard poor index slid about percent he was extremely reassuring to everyone on wall street and also in the business community said

exchange and was later the second highest ranking executive at goldman sachs mr cohn understood the nuances of free markets and complex organizations but was not locked into specific worldview as trader mr cohn was aggressive in predicting commodity price swings and betting money on his views as manager at goldman he was tough minded and   be critical and impatient his frustration over not being named chief executive was well telegraphed not least by his surprise decision to take job in the trump administration given his background he was regarded as the voice of wall street in the administration mantle that invited admiration and antipathy he is globalist and he understands economics and trade said bill george goldman board member think he was very stabilizing influence within the trump administration kathryn wylde the chief executive of the partnership for new york city business group said that she viewed mr cohn as real resource in washington he was somebody that the new

politically correct she said on tuesday evening lloyd blankfein goldman chief executive praised mr cohn in message on twitter writing gary cohn deserves credit for serving his country in first class way mr cohn role in the administration was not universally celebrated some lawmakers including senator elizabeth warren democrat of massachusetts were sharply critical of his appointment saying it was troubling to see such critical job go to someone whose firm was deeply connected to the financial crisis and ensuing recession some of mr trump core supporters were also skeptical of mr cohn because of his background they viewed him as foe of the populist agenda that helped propel mr trump to the presidency some white   aides disparagingly called him globalist gary on tuesday breitbart news published an article with the headline   globalist gary cohn tried to derail trump america first agenda mr cohn critics said that the timing of his departure made it appear as though he considered the tariff proposals unacceptable even as he stood by the president after the charlottesville episode every white   staffer has their breaking point said ron klain chief of staff to vice presidents joe

tax breaks for delta over its decision to cut ties with the in the short term dick will become another corporate poster child for how political polarization and so called negative partisanship an automatic rejection of members of the opposing party are infecting our society there will be rash of news stories about increased sales from liberal consumers rushing into dick stores to vote with their wallets conservative media will point to boycotts and highlight other retailers that are stepping in to serve disaffected consumers but the real   will be the long game activism represents historic shift in the way corporations intersect with national politics rather than chief executives shaping political discourse however our toxic political environment is dictating corporate strategy instead of being cast as practical technocrats who   unite us chief executives will be swept up in our cultural war just like university presidents celebrities professional athletes and religious leaders before them brands are likely to become even more segmented into red and blue strengthening the association between liberals and priuses and conservatives and cracker barrel corporate brand campaigns   soon resemble political campaigns with efforts to identify the most intensely loyal consumers for repeat purchases as opposed to attracting new ones mainstream brands may become as common as moderate politicians that is rare perhaps extinct species in   political environment twitter and paypal serve diverse customers   but their recent efforts to regulate their own platforms have led to allegations of political bias and incited competitors most companies are not prepared for this new world of politics pepsi and starbucks have already been victims of orchestrated fake news campaigns there will be many more as more companies take stands those remaining will be named and shamed on social media creating impossible choices in an environment where neutrality is not an option like our politicians corporate chiefs will have to quickly figure out what stand they should take on the issue of the day by reflecting on their core convictions and estimating how their customer base will react like pollsters they will have to assess which kind of consumers they can write off and which ones to curry favor with the right answer will vary by company geographic location who their employees are and how much they depend on favorable government regulation there is no going back lists are being kept and wins are being tallied by pressure groups aiming to get companies on their side the issues that divide us will keep being served up in relentless succession forcing companies to take stands on just about everything much of this is reflection of who we have become corporate america thrives by selling us what we want and they do that by appealing to our identities in for many americans our political identity seems to define us more than ever it already influences whom we

supported by book review nonfiction andrew lloyd webber hotheaded perfectionist by stuart emmrichmarch     the main   share this page     the main     andrew lloyd webber with his musical hero richard rodgers in credit image from unmasked unmasked by andrew lloyd webber illustrated pp harper harpercollins publishers until recently   have said the three most painful hours spent in broadway theater in were the ones watching glenn close gamely rasp her way through the lugubrious revival of sunset boulevard andrew lloyd webber musical version of the classic billy wilder movie close had starred in the original broadway production years earlier and time had not been kind to either her singing voice or the show itself but then on the second to last day of the year went to matinee of the recent revival of cats also by lloyd webber ending its year and half run that night the original broadway production of cats ran for years making it the longest running musical in broadway hi  until it was eclipsed by the still running phantom of the opera written by who else andrew lloyd webber surrounded by enthusiastic fans some of whom had come in costume sat through the frantically charmless first act before bolting for the exit at intermission at least got to hear memory so perhaps am not the ideal reader for lloyd webber memoir unmasked the first of what the composer suggests will be two volumes but as someone who has long been devoted theatergoer and can knowledgeably debate for instance the finer points of the angela lansbury versus tyne daly versus bernadette peters productions of gypsy have grudging admiration for someone who once had four shows running simultaneously on broadway tying record that had been held by the legendary rodgers and hammerstein and the original cast album of lloyd webber jesus christ superstar was certainly in heavy rotation during my youth as was its hit single don know how to love him moreover lloyd webber has worked over the years with some of the most compelling characters in musical theater among them harold prince patti lupone and cameron mackintosh and was hoping for some good dish particularly on lupone the evita star with whom lloyd webber later had famous feud after he fired her from the broadway production of sunset boulevard and replaced her with close but alas lloyd webber doesn appear to be much interested in dishing the dirt in this volume at least not in the tradition of most kiss and tell theatrical memoirs including lupone own which doesn shy away from naming names and settling scores lupone spends two full chapters bitterly recounting the sunset boulevard tale and lloyd webber points out that she once said evita was clearly written by composer who hates women advertisement     the main   in his preface lloyd webber implies that some readers may find his book lacking in dramatic narrative autobiographies are by definition self serving and mine is no exception he says adding he was pressured to write it by friends and literary agent and finally agreed primarily to shut them up     the main   advertisement     the main   not exactly the promise of page turner to come still he soldiers on and so must andrew lloyd webber who turns   was born in london westminster hospital to father who was talented but unambitious composer who turned instead to the academic world and mother who poured her own dreams into andrew and his younger brother   from the beginning lloyd webber showed distinct musical talent and he was an early fan of musical theater seeing the london productions of my fair lady and west side   while still child beginning to write school theatricals when he was and finding that his satirical portraits of the teachers suddenly made him popular with his peers boys were shouting lloydy lloydy he recalls the turning point in his career came in when he met tim rice whom his agent had recommended as potential lyricist for project the precocious year old was beginning to work on the meeting seemed to go well awe struck might be better way of describing my first encounter with timothy miles bindon rice lloyd webber says the two later went on to write joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat jesus christ superstar and evita parting ways around the time that cats was coming together as lyricist rice was replaced by long dead eliot one recurring theme of lloyd webber memoir is his increasingly fractious relationship with rice the two seem to have fallen out sometime around evita their collaboration apparently complicated by rice affair with elaine paige the leading lady in the original london production and by tensions over which of the two men was getting more credit for their growing fame final break came when rice was called in on cats to help write the lyrics for what   eventually become memory but his work never made it into the final product we had great years rice later told an interviewer very few artistic partnerships last more than years

subscribed to this email view all   newsletters see sample manage email preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime lloyd webber frequently drops hints that all was not well between the two at one point quoting his father saying you won have long term partnership with tim but he never states what exactly went wrong or demonstrates that he ever confronted rice about what he apparently saw as his undermining and occasionally deceitful ways the closest he comes is when he seems to suspect that rice was trying to undercut the forthcoming production of phantom by attempting to hijack its director hal prince for show of his own the other main character in lloyd webber life at least in the period covered in this book is the singer sarah brightman his second wife with whom he had an affair while still married to his first wife also named sarah and whom he later cast in the phantom of the opera even if you knew nothing of lloyd webber personal life and that this union did not last the author certainly foreshadows the fact that the marriage was doomed while describing her otherworldly singing voice and delicate beauty lloyd webber casually says that during their affair brightman was married to man no one ever seems to have seen and insinuates that she had reputation for becoming romantically entangled with colleagues sure enough when their split finally comes lloyd webber mentions in passing that brightman was apparently having an affair with keyboard player in the phantom orchestra lloyd webber seems to have found marital bliss with his third wife madeleine to whom he has been married for years the one revelation in the book has nothing to do with lloyd webber music or his romantic affairs it is the surprising assertion that in milos forman approached him about playing mozart in his film version of amadeus lloyd webber was appalled telling forman that he was hopeless actor but the director was undeterred you are hotheaded perfectionist who can be extremely obnoxious lloyd webber quotes him saying want you to play yourself lloyd webber writes that forman pursued him off and on for the next couple of years and that he managed to wriggle out of the director grasp only when he insisted jokingly he says in meeting with forman and some of the producers that mozart music be replaced by his own startlingly the producers seemed willing to go along until forman stepped in and stated the obvious think andrew is saying he doesn want to play the role the film with tom hulce taking on the role of mozart went on to win eight oscars my suspicion is that lloyd webber might have had similar conversation with his book editor arguing that he really didn want to write memoir if so readers may finish this book wishing the

different in this case we were not talking about politics mr frazier  d we were talking about the basic values of the country mr frazier did not respond to the president tweet and has not spoken

project known as dock is the brainchild of wework the fast growing new york start up valued at whopping billion in just eight years wework has built network of shared working spaces around the globe but wework chief executive and co founder adam neumann isn content to just lease out communal offices mr neumann lanky longhaired year old israeli wants nothing less than to radically transform the way we work live and play when dock is completed this year if the aggressive timeline holds it will represent the fullest expression of mr neumann expansive vision to date there will be an enormous co working space luxury spa and large offices for other companies like ibm and verizon that are designed and run by wework there will be juice bar real bar gym with boxing studio an outdoor basketball court and panoramic vistas of manhattan there will be restaurants and maybe even dry cleaning services and barbershop it will be the kind of place you never have to leave until you need to go to sleep and if mr neumann has his way you ll sleep at one of the apartments he is renting nearby it an all encompassing sort of ambition and mr neumann is the brash and idealistic pitchman simply by

business ve made that argument said bruce dunlevie wework board member and partner at the venture capital firm benchmark but he said great entrepreneurs like adam don listen to guys like me as wework expands in all directions it faces persistent questions about its rich valuation and the durability of its business model critics argue that the company does little more than corporate real estate arbitrage leasing space spiffing it up then subleasing it out to other tenants the company owns hardly any properties giving it precious few hard assets its growth projections strike many as unattainable and it has missed expectations before number of upstarts loom as potential competitors seeking to replicate wework success and many wework tenants are unproven start ups that   quickly fold iwg publicly traded co working company that has more members and more real estate than wework is valued at just billion yet mr neumann has convinced investors that wework is worth   that figure adam explanation for the valuation of wework speaks for itself said chris kelly co founder and president of convene company that offers flexible event spaces and is backed by major real estate firms this is not an excel spreadsheet calculation he believes there an energy behind the brand and he gotten people to invest at that valuation he has not tried to explain it in traditional financial terms indeed to assess wework by conventional metrics is to miss the point according to mr neumann wework isn really real estate company it state of consciousness he argues generation of interconnected

that the company will grow exponentially in the years to come making his multibillion dollar investment veritable bargain make it   bigger than your original plan mr son told forbes late last year if you think in that manner the valuation is cheap it can be worth few hundred billion dollars close communitiesthe notion that white collar workers might actually like their offices is relatively new one from the counting s of industrial england to the skyscrapers of manhattan offices were mostly uninspiring places designed to maximize space often with row upon row of unglamorous desks the only kind of model that anyone had for laying out large workplace was factory said nikil saval author of cubed secret hi  of the workplace so the office was made to resemble an assembly line this dreary state of affairs began to change in earnest at least for some during the dot com bubble tech companies built playful offices with beanbags and ping pong tables making work spaces less formal free food became commonplace raised expectations for amenities and interior design gradually seeped into the mainstream and   more and more employees e ly millennials expect enlightened unconventional offices enter wework with people bouncing between employers jobs concentrated in cities and technology making it easier to work remotely the demand for co working was suddenly real and ready to be monetized mr neumann who grew up on kibbutz in israel had an epiphany bring the communal vibe to the office soon he and friend mr mckelvey an equally tall oregonian who grew up on collective and was working as an architect founded an eco friendly co working space in brooklyn they sold it but they quickly turned around and started wework in me and miguel have this common ground mr neumann said we both grew

million and then million creditcole wilson for the  wework didn invent co working spaces of course iwg better known as regus has been around for decades but mr neumann and mr mckelvey quickly hit upon recipe that drew throngs of start ups an industrial chic aesthetic some big common areas with comfy couches free beer and piped in pop music individuals pay as little as month for occasional access to desk in common area start ups can pay few thousand dollars for private room on month to month basis and some big companies pay millions of dollars year for spaces that hold thousands of employees over multiple locations it formula that has caught on from new york to tel aviv to shanghai in new york alone wework has spaces most of them nearly full at the wework in harlem dance companies share space with hair care start ups in common area adorned with murals of jazz musicians at wework in tribeca fashion designers and alcohol distributors work shoulder to shoulder in spartan space decorated with neon lighting for wework to really succeed in changing the way we all work it is going to have to win over big corporations seeking space for thousands of employees the strategy is an odd reversal for wework which made its name catering to freelancers and start ups the weather channel recently moved its ad sales team into an enormous wework in midtown manhattan barbara bekkedahl who runs the group said the transition was easy and the space comfortable and stylish but ms bekkedahl had complaint too one that highlights one of the downsides of communal work space she suggested that the hygienic

customers all day so don always have the same standards gripes about grooming are unlikely to slow down wework business with corporate clients e ly if mr neumann makes good on his promise to save them money because wework is building out so much space and buying so much furniture mr neumann says he can renovate and operate an office for fraction of the cost that companies   normally spend we have economies of scale he said ll cut your operational costs between to percent it might seem like another instance of mr neumann talking big game but for the fact that more and more companies ge hsbc salesforce and microsoft among them are signing on for years now big companies have outsourced payroll processing janitorial services and security it not stretch to imagine more of them outsourcing the design and maintenance of their offices to company like wework we only have members mr mckelvey said that ridiculous we need to have two million and then million more we than me bankers and

have been music to his ears he believes that creating work and living environment where people mingle is in fact world changing innovation each wework has community manager who keeps tabs on members makes introductions and organizes social activities if more strangers are colliding by the grapefruit water the thinking goes they are more likely to meet up and invest in one another socially responsible start ups and then the world will be better place once you choose to enter wework you choose to be part of something more we than me mr neumann said people start coming together they ll see each other in the elevator they talk in the stairways there thousand other things they do elevators stairways hardly world changing innovations but wework takes extra steps to encourage fraternization like beer kegs that never run dry more than most companies wework promotes the consumption of alcohol as an inherent virtue posters on the wall encourage people to have drink there are

legal dispute with group of former janitors who tried to unionize at subcontractor that wework used the next year wework drew scrutiny for its use of arbitration to settle workplace disputes and for

teaching tykesin september wework will open its most ambitious project to date kindergarten it may also be the effort that tests whether wework is flying too close to the sun the creation of mr

into mr neumann expansive vision for creating generation of empathetic social impact entrepreneurs but the risk reward calculus is different when starting school wegrow won scale as rapidly as wework

some of the attributes that had allowed those other titans to succeed he has an instinctive feel for how millennials are going to want to have community work experiences without joining large corporations mr isaacson said and like steve jobs and other great entrepreneurs he knows how to connect the humanities with business and technology make life it can be tempting to dismiss wework as just another overvalued start up that is high on its own rhetoric and flush with easy money from na ve investors with little more than faddish interior design free beer and an invitation to socialize with strangers mr neumann claims to have conjured up whole new paradigm for white collar workers and for education and vows that it can change the world it the kind of utopian prattle that can come

advertisementopinionsupported byop ed contributora killing in saskatchewanby gabrielle scrimshawfeb imagecreditpatrick kylelast friday jury in battleford saskatchewan found gerald stanley not guilty of second degree murder mr stanley farmer had killed colten boushie year old indigenous man who he believed was trying to rob him mr boushie was shot in the head while sitting in the back seat of parked vehicle no one denies that gerald stanley shot colten boushie the problem for many canadians is mr stanley claim that mr boushie death was an accident the all white jury agreed with mr stanley defense even dismissing the lesser charge of manslaughter the verdict prompted huge outcry last weekend thousands marched in rallies across canada with indigenous activists pointing to the systemic racism in the justice system the conduct of the royal canadian mounted police officers who investigated the shooting and the legal process itself have come under intense scrutiny alvin baptiste mr boushie uncle said the authorities treated the family as though they did something wrong and in the run up to mr stanley two week trial the defense excluded five potential jurors who were visibly indigenous in response to complaints the police admitted that their actions   have been perceived as insensitive and the government plans to review the jury selection process while on tour in california prime minister justin trudeau acknowledged the grief of mr boushie family stating he was sending love from the united states later he added there are systemic issues in our criminal justice system that we must address and this week he met with mr boushie family for many indigenous people the verdict in the boushie murder trial is part of cycle of government apologies and tears followed by limited progress on achieving equality for indigenous people if canada is to mend its systemic inequalities it needs to first address its problem with racism national truth and reconciliation commission reported in that canada committed cultural genocide against indigenous people through long term government policy including separating children from their families forced migration and outlawing language and cultural practices the intergenerational trauma wrought by these policies has left indigenous people at the bottom of nearly every social and economic indicator suicide rates for indigenous youth are among the highest in the world indigenous people are   more likely to be incarcerated nearly twice as likely to be unemployed and can be up to three   as likely to experience food insecurity in saskatchewan large agricultural province with just over one million people one in residents identifies as indigenous the province had the second largest number of indian residential schools in canada the government funded church run schools that forcibly took generations of indigenous children from their communities in an attempt to assimilate them into white society thousands of children perished while attending these schools and the physical mental and sexual abuse many endured is well documented in saskatchewan tensions between indigenous and non indigenous people run several generations deep yet for many people in canada the reaction to the boushie verdict has come as surprise study in found that canadians have only recently begun to understand the discrimination faced by indigenous people and many feel it is no different from that faced by other minority populations in the country this can be explained partly by an urban rural divide eighty percent of canadians live in cities and half of indigenous people reside in rural areas leaving many urbanites unaware of the systemic and longstanding racism plaguing indigenous people but if you look beyond the urban enclaves to canada rural backyard you see more complete picture grew up in small saskatchewan town two hours east of where mr boushie was killed as dene girl of was accused of stealing while was browsing the aisles of girls accessories store was when friend cree hockey player said white man spat on him during game when was in college young man whose father brother and uncle were members of the royal canadian mounted police declared one night that he wanted to be police officer so that he   shoot some indians was young trying to make friends and didn challenge the comment later when mentioned the incident to person there that evening he told me that the comment wasn about race but the fact that natives just commit more crime failing to call out racism makes it easier for people to believe there isn any worse yet racism becomes so acceptable we stop being able to recognize it in november major political candidate said that when he was growing up in saskatchewan he didn even know that racism existed it took me years to find the courage to call out racism when see it canada doesn have that long one in three indigenous people is under the age of and these young people are growing up facing discrimination at every turn while canadians debate the role of racism in the boushie trial and verdict indigenous people are losing faith in the justice system the government and

likely to buy apple products after hearing tim cook statement opposing indiana religious freedom bill but other firms have faced angry consumers and had to retrench as target did when hundreds of

not brought people together working from the middle out instead this type of activism largely from the progressive side has begun to galvanize conservatives for example in georgia lawmakers stripped

automatic rejection of members of the opposing party are infecting our society there will be rash of news stories about increased sales from liberal consumers rushing into dick stores to vote with their wallets conservative media will point to boycotts and highlight other retailers that are stepping in to serve disaffected consumers but the real   will be the long game activism represents historic shift in the way corporations intersect with national politics rather than chief executives shaping political discourse however our toxic political environment is dictating corporate strategy instead of being cast as practical technocrats who   unite us chief executives will be swept up in our cultural war just like university presidents celebrities professional athletes and religious leaders before them brands are likely to become even more segmented into red and blue strengthening the association between liberals and priuses and conservatives and cracker barrel corporate brand campaigns   soon resemble political campaigns with efforts to identify the most intensely loyal consumers for repeat purchases as opposed to attracting new ones mainstream brands may become as common

to allegations of political bias and incited competitors most companies are not prepared for this new world of politics pepsi and starbucks have already been victims of orchestrated fake news campaigns there will be many more as more companies take stands those remaining will be named and shamed on social media creating impossible choices in an environment where neutrality is not an option like our politicians corporate chiefs will have to quickly figure out what stand they should take on the issue of the day by reflecting on their core convictions and estimating how their customer base will react like pollsters they will have to assess which kind of consumers they can write off and which ones to curry favor with the right answer will vary by company geographic location who their employees are and how much they depend on favorable government regulation there is no going back lists are being kept and wins are being tallied by pressure groups aiming to get companies on their side the issues that divide us will keep being served up in relentless succession forcing companies to take stands on just about everything much of this is reflection of who we have become corporate

perhaps am not the ideal reader for lloyd webber memoir unmasked the first of what the composer suggests will be two volumes but as someone who has long been devoted theatergoer and can knowledgeably debate for instance the finer points of the angela lansbury versus tyne daly versus bernadette peters productions of gypsy have grudging admiration for someone who once had four shows running simultaneously on broadway tying record that had been held by the legendary rodgers and hammerstein and the original cast album of lloyd webber jesus christ superstar was certainly in heavy rotation during my youth as was its hit single don know how to love him moreover lloyd webber has worked over the years with some of the most compelling characters in musical theater among them harold prince patti lupone and cameron mackintosh and was hoping for some good dish particularly on lupone the evita star with whom lloyd webber later had famous feud after he fired her from the broadway production of sunset boulevard and replaced her with close but alas lloyd webber doesn appear to be much interested in dishing the dirt in this volume at least not in the tradition of most kiss and tell theatrical memoirs including lupone own which doesn shy away from naming names and settling scores lupone spends two full chapters bitterly recounting the sunset boulevard tale and lloyd webber points out that she once said evita was clearly written by composer who hates women in his preface lloyd webber implies that some readers may find his book lacking in dramatic narrative autobiographies are by definition self serving and mine is no exception he says adding he was pressured to write it by friends and literary agent and finally agreed primarily to shut them up not exactly the promise of page turner to come still he soldiers on and so must andrew lloyd webber who turns   was born in london westminster hospital to father who was talented but unambitious composer who turned instead to the academic world and mother who poured her own dreams into andrew and his younger brother imagefrom the beginning lloyd webber showed distinct musical talent and he was an early fan of musical theater seeing the london productions of my fair lady and west side   while still child beginning to write school theatricals when he was and finding that his satirical portraits of the teachers suddenly made him popular with his peers boys were shouting lloydy lloydy he recalls the turning point in his career came in when he met tim rice whom his agent had recommended as potential lyricist for project the precocious year old was beginning to work on the meeting seemed to go well awe struck might be better way of describing my first encounter with timothy miles bindon rice lloyd webber says the two later went on to write joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat jesus christ superstar and evita parting ways around the time that cats was coming together as lyricist rice was replaced by long dead eliot one recurring theme of lloyd webber memoir is his increasingly fractious relationship with rice the two seem to have fallen out sometime around evita their collaboration apparently complicated by rice affair with elaine paige the leading lady in the original london production and by tensions over which of the two men was getting more credit for their growing fame final break came when rice was called in on cats to help write the lyrics for what   eventually become memory but his work never made it into the final product we had great years rice later told an interviewer very few artistic partnerships last more than years and if they do they tend to go down the tubes lloyd webber frequently drops hints that all was not well between the two at one point quoting his father saying you won have long term partnership with tim but he never states what exactly went wrong or demonstrates that he ever confronted rice about what he apparently saw as his undermining and occasionally deceitful ways the closest he comes is when he seems to suspect that rice was trying to undercut the forthcoming production of phantom by attempting to hijack its director hal prince for show of his own the other main character in lloyd webber life at least in the period covered in this book is the singer sarah brightman his second wife with whom he had an affair while still married to his first wife also named sarah and whom he later cast in the phantom of the opera even if you knew nothing of lloyd webber personal life and that this union did not last the author certainly foreshadows the fact that the marriage was doomed while describing her otherworldly singing voice and delicate beauty lloyd webber casually says that during their affair brightman was married to man no one ever seems to have seen and insinuates that she had reputation for becoming romantically entangled with colleagues sure enough when their split finally comes lloyd webber mentions in passing that brightman was apparently having an affair with keyboard player in the phantom orchestra lloyd webber seems to have found marital bliss with his third wife madeleine to whom he has been married for years the one revelation in the book has nothing to do with lloyd webber music or his romantic affairs it is the surprising assertion that in milos forman approached him about playing mozart in his film version of amadeus lloyd webber was appalled telling forman that he was hopeless actor but the director was undeterred you are hotheaded perfectionist who can be extremely obnoxious lloyd webber quotes him saying want you to play yourself lloyd webber writes that forman pursued him off and on for the next couple of years and that he managed to wriggle out of the director grasp only when he insisted jokingly he says in meeting with forman and some of the producers that mozart music be replaced by his own startlingly the producers seemed willing to go along until forman stepped in and stated the obvious think andrew is saying he doesn want to play the role the film with tom hulce taking on the role of mozart went on to win eight oscars my suspicion is that lloyd webber might have had similar conversation with his book editor arguing that he really didn want to write memoir if so readers may finish this book wishing the editor had agreed stuart

still married to his first wife also named sarah and whom he later cast in the phantom of the opera even if you knew nothing of lloyd webber personal life and that this union did not last the author certainly foreshadows the fact that the marriage was doomed while describing her otherworldly singing voice and delicate beauty lloyd webber casually says that during their affair brightman was married to man no one ever seems to have seen and insinuates that she had reputation for becoming romantically entangled with colleagues sure enough when their split finally comes lloyd webber mentions in passing that brightman was apparently having an affair with keyboard player in the phantom orchestra lloyd webber seems to have found marital bliss with his third wife madeleine to whom he has been married for years the one revelation in the book has nothing to do with lloyd webber music or his romantic affairs it is the surprising assertion that in milos forman approached him about playing mozart in his film version of amadeus lloyd webber was appalled telling forman that he was hopeless actor but the director was undeterred you are hotheaded perfectionist who can be extremely obnoxious lloyd webber quotes him saying want you to play yourself lloyd webber writes that forman pursued him off and on for the next couple of years and that he managed to wriggle out of the director grasp only when he insisted jokingly he says in meeting with forman and some of the producers that mozart music be replaced by his own startlingly the producers seemed willing to go along until forman stepped in and stated the obvious think andrew is saying he doesn want to play the role the film with tom hulce taking on the role of mozart went on to win eight oscars my suspicion is that lloyd webber might have had similar conversation with his book editor arguing that he really didn want to write memoir if so readers may finish this book wishing the editor had agreed stuart

project known as dock is the brainchild of wework the fast growing new york start up valued at whopping billion in just eight years wework has built network of shared working spaces around the globe but wework chief executive and co founder adam neumann isn content to just lease out communal offices mr neumann lanky longhaired year old israeli wants nothing less than to radically transform the way we work live and play when dock is completed this year if the aggressive timeline holds it will represent the fullest expression of mr neumann expansive vision to date there will be an enormous co

business ve made that argument said bruce dunlevie wework board member and partner at the venture capital firm benchmark but he said great entrepreneurs like adam don listen to guys like me as wework expands in all directions it faces persistent questions about its rich valuation and the durability of its business model critics argue that the company does little more than corporate real estate arbitrage leasing space spiffing it up then subleasing it out to other tenants the company owns hardly any properties giving it precious few hard assets its growth projections strike many as unattainable and it has missed expectations before number of upstarts loom as potential competitors seeking to replicate wework success and many wework tenants are unproven start ups that   quickly

adam explanation for the valuation of wework speaks for itself said chris kelly co founder and president of convene company that offers flexible event spaces and is backed by major real estate firms this is not an excel spreadsheet calculation he believes there an energy behind the brand and he gotten people to invest at that valuation he has not tried to explain it in traditional financial terms indeed to assess wework by conventional metrics is to miss the point according to mr neumann wework isn really real estate company it state of consciousness he argues generation of interconnected

that the company will grow exponentially in the years to come making his multibillion dollar investment veritable bargain make it   bigger than your original plan mr son told forbes late last year if you think in that manner the valuation is cheap it can be worth few hundred billion dollars close communitiesthe notion that white collar workers might actually like their offices is relatively new one from the counting s of industrial england to the skyscrapers of manhattan offices were mostly uninspiring places designed to maximize space often with row upon row of unglamorous desks the only kind of model that anyone had for laying out large workplace was factory said nikil saval author of cubed secret hi  of the workplace so the office was made to resemble an assembly line this dreary state of affairs began to change in earnest at least for some during the dot com bubble tech companies built playful offices with beanbags and ping pong tables making work spaces less formal free food became commonplace raised expectations for amenities and interior design gradually seeped into the mainstream and   more and more employees e ly millennials expect enlightened unconventional offices enter wework with people bouncing between employers jobs concentrated in cities and technology making it easier to work remotely the demand for co working was suddenly real and ready to be monetized mr neumann who grew up on kibbutz in israel had an epiphany bring the communal vibe to the office soon he and friend mr mckelvey an equally tall oregonian who grew up on collective and was working as an architect founded an eco friendly co working space in brooklyn they sold it but they quickly turned around and started wework in me and miguel have this common ground mr neumann said we both grew up in very close communities image we only have members says miguel mckelvey the other co founder referring to the people and companies that rent space from wework that ridiculous we need to have two million and then million creditcole wilson for the  wework didn invent co working spaces of course iwg better known as regus has been around for decades but mr neumann and mr mckelvey quickly hit upon recipe that drew throngs of start ups an industrial chic aesthetic some big common areas with comfy couches free beer and piped in pop music individuals pay as little as month for occasional access to desk in common area start ups can pay few thousand dollars for private room on month to month basis and some big companies pay millions of dollars year for spaces that hold thousands of employees over multiple locations it formula that has caught on from new york to tel aviv to shanghai in new york alone wework has spaces most of them nearly full at the wework in harlem dance companies share space with hair care start ups in common area adorned with murals of jazz musicians at wework in tribeca fashion designers and alcohol distributors work shoulder to shoulder in spartan space decorated with neon lighting for wework to really succeed in changing the way we all work it is going to have to win over big corporations seeking space for thousands of employees the strategy is an odd reversal for wework which made its name catering to freelancers and start ups the weather channel recently moved its ad sales team into an enormous wework in midtown manhattan barbara bekkedahl who runs the group said the transition was easy and the space comfortable and stylish but ms bekkedahl had complaint too one that highlights one of the downsides of communal work space she suggested that the hygienic and sartorial habits of some of her new office mates were lacking as tv sales team we groom and dress for outside sales she said some of the techie and start up types  d at wework aren facing customers all day so don always have the same standards gripes about grooming are unlikely to slow down wework business with corporate clients e ly if mr neumann makes good on his promise to save them money because wework is building out so much space and buying so much furniture mr neumann says he can renovate and operate an office for fraction of the cost that companies   normally spend we have economies of scale he said ll cut your operational costs between to percent it might seem like another instance of mr neumann talking big game but for the fact that more and more companies ge hsbc salesforce and microsoft among them are signing on for years now big companies have outsourced payroll processing janitorial services and security it not stretch to imagine more of them outsourcing the design and maintenance of their offices to company like wework we only have members mr mckelvey said that ridiculous we need to have two million and then million more we than me bankers and lawyers poured out of skyscrapers and made for the suburbs on recent monday night in manhattan financial district but at wall street building controlled entirely by wework the party was just getting

wework space and exercise at wework nearby gym rise it awesome jake decicco said you just roll out of bed go down the elevator and get to work had mr neumann been there to share beer those words   have been music to his ears he believes that creating work and living environment where people mingle is in fact world changing innovation each wework has community manager who keeps tabs on members makes introductions and organizes social activities if more strangers are colliding by the grapefruit water the thinking goes they are more likely to meet up and invest in one another socially responsible start ups and then the world will be better place once you choose to enter wework you choose to be part of something more we than me mr neumann said people start coming together they ll see each other in the elevator they talk in the stairways there thousand other things they do elevators stairways hardly world changing innovations but wework takes extra steps to encourage fraternization like beer kegs that never run dry more than most companies wework promotes the consumption of alcohol as an inherent virtue posters on the wall encourage people to have drink there are wine tastings at welive company parties feature top shelf liquor mr neumann has well known penchant for tequila and well stocked bar is prominent in his office on recent tuesday at the community

there was an invitation to share wine and cake in the common area though alcohol is social lubricant for some it can be off putting to many others many women have shared stories of feeling uncomfortable with what they described as frat   culture at some weworks prompting some to leave as wework has grown minor scandals have rattled the company in the company grew ensnared in complicated legal dispute with group of former janitors who tried to unionize at subcontractor that wework used the next year wework drew scrutiny for its use of arbitration to settle workplace disputes and for its firing of an employee who refused to adhere to related policy but so far nothing not alcohol labor disputes questions about the business fundamentals or bad publicity has managed to alter the company trajectory we re disrupter of the way people view the spaces they work in on day to day basis said mr dunlevie of benchmark and we re in the early days of taking advantage of that phenomenon teaching tykesin september wework will open its most ambitious project to date kindergarten it may also be the effort that tests whether wework is flying too close to the sun the creation of mr neumann wife rebekah the school is known as wegrow when it opens it promises well designed space with curriculum that emphasizes socializing and entrepreneurship for year olds on up wegrow fits neatly into mr neumann expansive vision for creating generation of empathetic social impact entrepreneurs but the risk reward calculus is different when starting school wegrow won scale as rapidly as wework has so the financial upside is limited yet should something go wrong the fallout   be devastating it one thing to be responsible for the internet going out or paper running low at the communal printer

definitely not are we going to make mistakes hundred percent are we going to be comfortable admitting those mistakes definitely it what we do here though such unbridled zeal can be abrasive to some it   also be viewed as the mark of peripatetic savant walter isaacson the biographer of steve jobs albert einstein benjamin franklin and leonardo da vinci counts mr neumann as friend and said he shared some of the attributes that had allowed those other titans to succeed he has an instinctive feel for how millennials are going to want to have community work experiences without joining large corporations mr isaacson said and like steve jobs and other great entrepreneurs he knows how to connect the humanities with business and technology make life it can be tempting to dismiss wework as just another overvalued start up that is high on its own rhetoric and flush with easy money from na ve investors with little more than faddish interior design free beer and an invitation to socialize with strangers mr neumann claims to have conjured up whole new paradigm for white collar workers and for education and vows that it can change the world it the kind of utopian prattle that can come off as dangerously out of touch at moment when backlash against big tech is brewing but if any of these potential pitfalls concern mr neumann he doesn show it on wednesday night in january mr neumann

creditmike cohen for the  by david gellesfeb one of the nation most powerful black chief executives is breaking his silence after publicly sparring with president trump last year kenneth frazier the chief executive of the pharmaceuticals company merck served on one of mr trump business advisory councils in the early days of the administration but after mr trump equivocated in his response to an outburst of white nationalist violence last august in charlottesville va the advisory groups swiftly unraveled mr frazier the grandson of man born into slavery was the first of series of chief executives to distance themselves from the president feel responsibility to take stand against extremism he wrote on merck twitter account at the time in recent interview with the   mr frazier elaborated for the first time on his motivation for taking stance it was my view that to not take stand on this   be viewed as tacit endorsement of what had happened and what was said he said think words have consequences and think actions have consequences just felt that as matter of my own personal conscience   not remain mr frazier spoke to the   for the corner office column series of interviews with business leaders that was regular feature from until last fall it will return next month with fuller interview with mr frazier in which he covers broad range of topics including his upbringing his early career and merck efforts to fight cancer and other diseases the events that led to mr frazier confrontation with the president unfolded over tense summer weekend as white nationalists gathered in charlottesville to protest the removal of statue of robert lee bloody fighting broke out as they clashed with counterdemonstrators one of whom was killed when self described neo nazi drove his car into crowd of people saw what was happening on that friday night and then heard the horrible news about what had happened on saturday with the young woman being killed and others being run down by person who was sympathetic to people who held views that consider personally noxious mr frazier said and then heard the president response mr trump speaking at veterans event at one of his golf clubs condemned the violence but did not criticize the white nationalists chanting neo nazi slogans he blamed hatred bigotry and violence on many sides on many sides the president remarks drew widespread condemnation for appearing to equate the actions of the counterprotesters with those of neo nazis and many americans including mr frazier found them deeply inadequate in that moment the president response was one that felt was not in concordance with my views mr frazier said and didn think they were in concordance with the views that we claim to hold as country before announcing his decision to resign from the president manufacturing council mr frazier consulted with the merck board wanted to say that this was statement was making in terms of my own values and the company values and there was unanimous support for that he said my board supported that percent then on monday morning merck posted statement from mr frazier on twitter am resigning from the president american manufacturing council it read in part our country strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths races sexual orientations and political beliefs the president not one to let slight go swiftly hit back on twitter now that ken frazier of merck pharma has resigned from president manufacturing council he will have more time to lower ripoff drug prices the president wrote for most of that monday mr frazier was the lonely voice of opposition among business leaders with few chief executives offering their support for him but on monday night the chief executives of intel and under armour also stepped down from the advisory groups by wednesday dozens of the country top chief executives had reached the same conclusion they   no longer be part of the advisory councils the groups were disbanded mr frazier doesn regret his initial decision to advise the president joined because think merck is an important company and has something to contribute to the discussion about how we   as country become much more competitive in the global economy he said joined because the president asked me to join and thought it was the right thing to do as the of company like merck and mr trump remarks after charlottesville were not the first time that mr frazier found himself at odds with the president there were things that happened earlier on in this administration that didn necessarily agree with about immigration and climate change but didn think that it was my role to actually speak out on those issues he said there process for deciding how we address those issues as country this is democracy but he viewed mr trump unwillingness to condemn white nationalists as different in this case we were not talking about politics mr frazier  d we were talking about the basic values of the country mr frazier did not respond to the president tweet and has not spoken publicly about the episode until now for man who rose to the pinnacle of corporate america mr frazier came from humble background his grandfather was born into slavery in south carolina and his father was janitor in philadelphia yet mr frazier parents pushed him to believe he   achieve great things they believed that despite the hi  of this country as it related to african americans that for my siblings and there   be tremendous opportunity he said they also instilled that it was our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities that they did not have mr frazier attended pennsylvania state university after earning degree from harvard law school he went to work at drinker biddle reath law firm in philadelphia while there he began representing merck and took on pro bono work he spent several summers in south africa teaching black law students and he took

convinced of mr cochran innocence they eventually secured him new trial and he was acquitted in it was by far the most important thing that ve ever done in my life full stop professionally mr frazier

advertisementopinionsupported byop ed contributora killing in saskatchewanby gabrielle scrimshawfeb imagecreditpatrick kylelast friday jury in battleford saskatchewan found gerald stanley not guilty of second degree murder mr stanley farmer had killed colten boushie year old indigenous man who he believed was trying to rob him mr boushie was shot in the head while sitting in the back seat of parked vehicle no one denies that gerald stanley shot colten boushie the problem for many canadians is mr stanley claim that mr boushie death was an accident the all white jury agreed with mr stanley defense even dismissing the lesser charge of manslaughter the verdict prompted huge outcry last weekend thousands marched in rallies across canada with indigenous activists pointing to the systemic racism in the justice system the conduct of the royal canadian mounted police officers who investigated the shooting and the legal process itself have come under intense scrutiny alvin baptiste mr boushie uncle said the authorities treated the family as though they did something wrong and in the run up to mr stanley two week trial the defense excluded five potential jurors who were visibly indigenous in response to complaints the police admitted that their actions   have been perceived as insensitive and the government plans to review the jury selection process while on tour in california prime minister justin trudeau acknowledged the grief of mr boushie family stating he was sending love from the united states later he added there are systemic issues in our criminal justice system that we must address and this week he met with mr boushie family for many indigenous people the verdict in the boushie murder trial is part of cycle of government apologies and tears followed by limited progress on achieving equality for indigenous people if canada is to mend its systemic inequalities it needs to first address its problem with racism national truth and reconciliation commission reported in that canada committed cultural genocide against indigenous people through long term government policy including separating children from their families forced migration and outlawing language and cultural practices the intergenerational trauma wrought by these policies has left indigenous people at the bottom of nearly every social and economic indicator suicide rates for indigenous youth are among the highest in the world indigenous people are   more likely to be incarcerated nearly twice as likely to be unemployed and can be up to three   as likely to experience food insecurity in saskatchewan large agricultural province with just over one million people one in residents identifies as indigenous the province had the second largest number of indian residential schools in canada the government funded church run schools that forcibly took generations of indigenous children from their communities in an attempt to assimilate them into white society thousands of children perished while attending these schools and the physical mental and sexual abuse many endured is well documented in saskatchewan tensions between indigenous and non indigenous people run several generations deep yet for many people in canada the reaction to the boushie verdict has come as surprise study in found that canadians have only recently begun to understand the discrimination faced by indigenous people and many feel it is no different from that faced by other minority populations in the country this can be explained partly by an urban rural divide eighty percent of canadians live in cities and half of indigenous people reside in rural areas leaving many urbanites unaware of the systemic and longstanding racism plaguing indigenous people but if you look beyond the urban enclaves to canada rural backyard you see more complete picture grew up in small saskatchewan town two hours east of where mr boushie was killed as dene girl of was accused of stealing while was browsing the aisles of girls accessories store was when friend cree hockey player said white man spat on him during game when was in college young man whose father brother and uncle were members of the royal canadian mounted police declared one night that he wanted to be police officer so that he   shoot some indians was young trying to make friends and didn challenge the comment later when mentioned the incident to person there that evening he told me that the comment wasn about race but the fact that natives just commit more crime failing to call out racism makes it easier for people to believe there isn any worse yet racism becomes so acceptable we stop being able to recognize it in november major political candidate said that when he was growing up in saskatchewan he didn even know that racism existed it took me years to find the courage to call out racism when see it canada doesn have that long one in three indigenous people is under the age of and these young people are growing up facing discrimination at every turn while canadians debate the role of racism in the boushie trial and verdict indigenous people are losing faith in the justice system the government and the idea of reconciliation canadians need to absorb the century long hi  of systemic racism that led to colten boushie killing   the findings from the truth and reconciliation commission final report   be good start until our leaders and regular canadians state plainly that canada has problem with racism indigenous people will   to have their lives cut short gabrielle scrimshaw joint degree

advertisementsupported byas conservatives gather anger at the news media runs deepimagevice president mike pence speaking at the conservative political action conference on thursday accused journalists of fawning over the sister of the north korean leader kim jong un he was far from the only speaker to attack the news media creditpete marovich for the  by michael grynbaumfeb oxon hill md it did not seem like coincidence that the very first panel of this year conservative political action conference took direct aim at the state of journalism in the united states the opening session on thursday an affair to remember how the far left and the mainstream media got in bed together began with youtube style mash up of the year biggest media blunders the audience jeered joy behar of the view and jim acosta of cnn it whooped at clip of president trump thundering at mr acosta you are fake news this annual gathering is usually moment to hammer out what divides the fractious conservative movement what it has revealed so far is what unites it contempt for fakenews and the journalists that the former breitbart news writer ben shapiro memorably described as advocates of leftism masquerading as objective truth tellers mr shapiro provocateur with growing following among millennial conservatives brought the crowd to its feet when he declared the media are lying about you they are lying about me some attendees turned toward the reporters gathered in the back of hotel ballroom here and gave them taunting thumbs down but mr shapiro was far from the most prominent speaker whose fiery media criticism delighted the conservative faithful vice president mike pence accused journalists of fawning over the sister of the north korean leader kim jong un her sphinx like appearance beside mr pence at the winter olympics in south korea this month drew wide attention some commentators had criticized mr pence for remaining seated when the unified korean olympic team marched in the opening ceremony snub that they called disrespectful to american allies in south korea for all those in the media who think should have stood and cheered with the north koreans say the united states of america doesn stand with murderous dictatorships we stand up to murderous dictatorships mr pence said his words nearly drowned out by applause and cheers perhaps the most fervent anti media broadsides came from dana loesch the spokeswoman for the national rifle association who used her remarks to accuse news organizations of rooting for gun massacres many in legacy media love mass shootings ms loesch said eliciting nods and approving shouts addressing the reporters in the room she said you guys love it not saying that you love the tragedy but am saying that you love the ratings crying white mothers are ratings gold the incendiary dig was not much of surprise at conference that attracts wide spectrum of right wing groups and news outlets many of which have honed the provocation of liberals into fine and some  profitable art still some of ms loesch other remarks reiterating the arguments for defending the second amendment and calling for more guns in schools drew more tepid reaction from the audience perhaps sign of how the national outcry after the school shooting in parkland fla has become backdrop for this week gathering it was her media attacks that played best like when she said that she needed security detail to leave the televised cnn town hall with gun violence survivors where she spoke on wednesday night there were people rushing the stage and screaming burn her ms loesch said cnn spokesman said on thursday that the network security personnel accompanied all the town hall speakers including ms loesch from the stage and that ms loesch also had her own private security the spokesman did not say whether she had been threatened after ms loesch remarks on thursday some journalists chafed at the idea that they were exploiting the deaths of children the point of all of this is to say that people in the media aren real human beings with souls and families and feelings which is disgusting elise foley reporter at huffpost wrote on twitter the scorn toward journalists here reflected genuine concern from some attendees that mainstream news outlets willfully misunderstand conservatives several speakers expressed sense of victimhood that their beliefs were portrayed by reporters as intolerant or tantamount to bigotry and there were reminders that the media as punching bag trope among conservatives is tactic that shows few signs of going away they think it just because president trump is being mean to the media and we re all following trump mr shapiro said from the stage referring to his followers disdain toward the press no he

conspiracy peter thiel hulk hogan gawker and the anatomy of intrigue by ryan holiday pp portfolio penguin what do we make of the curious case of ryan holiday and his captivating new book conspiracy about the riveting drama that conjoined in kind of bataan death march the unlikely trio of the silicon valley billionaire peter thiel the pro wrestling superstar hulk hogan terry bollea and the gawker founder nick denton   peter thiel credit andrew white for the   is holiday gifted autodidact as one   easily believe after absorbing the elegant spare prose of conspiracy and its seemingly timeless message about human nature or is he simply the master media manipulator he once proudly boasted to be in forbes is conspiracy profound masterwork by talented young writer or merely another pelt for the mantle on holiday acre ranch in bastrop county tex what clear is that holiday is an out of the box thinker who likes to take chances california native he quit the university of california riverside after his sophomore year to take year job at the collective hollywood talent agency he had turned summer internship into an offer of full time employment and was egged on by samantha hoover classmate and the woman who   become holiday wife was the kid who was going places he told the   in profile he apprenticed with the best selling author robert greene and before long american apparel the mostly defunct retail clothing chain lured holiday away to head the company public relations department in the middle of crisis its founder dov charney was accused of sexual assault holiday eventually resigned and american apparel filed for bankruptcy advertisement     the main   appalled and disillusioned holiday scored six figure advance to write an expos of the public relations game starting him on new career path of author journalist and hipster provocateur he and hoover lived together in los angeles new orleans and then new york city in they bought ranch near austin and started raising two chickens two goats biscuit and bucket and family by their brood had grown to include cattle three goats chickens ducks geese guinea hen and baby son holiday also has gauge shotgun caliber rifle bow and arrow and winchester that he keeps by his bed to ward off coyotes   holiday is the founder of brass check marketing and advisory firm with clients like google and the authors tony robbins tim ferriss and of course greene the name brass check is an example of holiday wit it refers both to upton sinclair account of the journalism industry and to slang for when bullet is in the chamber of semiautomatic pistol and ready to be fired he is also the media columnist for the new york observer owned by family trust associated with jared kushner he is years old conspiracy is his seventh book     the main   advertisement     the main   it is important for the book readers to be aware that holiday the college dropout is also huge believer in stoicism an ancient greek and roman philosophy that preaches suffering humility acceptance and endurance without complaint he became zealot while at college after   marcus aurelius meditations four   in row and then affixing his favorite passages from the book to the walls of his dorm room holiday is nothing if not erudite every time you turn around in conspiracy he is trying to make profound points by quoting from vast range of philosophers statesmen and great thinkers everyone from machiavelli and seneca to kierkegaard and george trow and on and on but incessant name dropping aside which tends to detract from his gripping narrative holiday has written one helluva page turner he documents how starting in the secretive thiel sought to take revenge on denton for outing him on gawker just because denton   and because he figured the news   generate the clicks and the kind of attention denton and his erstwhile enterprise craved thiel rightly offended began stealth campaign to punish denton for his callous and cavalier behavior   hulk hogan credit chris carlson associated press at chance meeting in germany thiel enlisted the help of someone holiday refers to only as mr and then charles harder the los angeles attorney who recently represented donald trump in his wildly unsuccessful legal effort to stop the publication of michael wolff fire and fury armed with million or so from thiel mr and harder dug up everything they   find about denton his colleagues at gawker gawker itself its parent company gawker media and some of the other people gawker offended they also needed novel legal theory about what denton had done figuring that the first amendment   protect denton and gawker when in october gawker made the momentous decision to publish without permission excerpts from sex tape involving hogan and his former best friend wife thiel not only had the perfect protagonist in an equally angry and determined hogan but also legal theory based on the idea that hogan privacy had been invaded as had thiel five years earlier unbeknown to denton and his company lawyers thiel had decided to bankroll hogan in his legal battle against gawker and denton in classic david and goliath fashion denton tragically underestimated his foes and paid the iron price as has been well documented elsewhere denton lost the five count lawsuit in florida courtroom and was slapped with million verdict gawker media had no choice but to file for bankruptcy its carcass was sold to the highest bidder to his considerable credit and for reasons that aren entirely made clear holiday decided to write conspiracy after both thiel and denton approached him separately wanting to share with him their views of the blockbuster case he less successful it seems to me in pushing his view throughout the book that thiel mr hogan and harder were involved in an old fashioned conspiracy in the stoical sense of the word to bring down denton and his crew yes they triumphed wildly and beyond anything they   have expected but  n that just be chalked up to having the better and more sympathetic legal argument rather than to having better tactics strategies and morally superior way of living of course this occam razor approach to the gawker case   not lend itself as easily to public relations mastermind skills conspiracy was embargoed for reasons that aren clear either much of its contents are already publicly

advertisementopinionsupported bytrump hacked the media right before our eyesby ross douthatmarch imagewe never stopped watching credit andrew harrer bloomberglet get one thing straight am not fan of facebook confident that social media is cancer on our private lives and source of derangement in our politics take it for granted that the tech barons are acquiring the power to tilt elections and that they ll be happy to play handmaidens to tyrants soft and hard so long as they can monetize our data take certain mordant pleasure in watching mark zuckerberg and his minions scapegoated for the political failures of late obama era liberalism but the liberal establishment fixation on facebook sins first the transmission of fake news and now the exploitation of its data by the trump campaign or its appendages still feels like classic example of blaming something new because it new when it the old thing that mattered more or of blaming something new because you thought that new meant good that the use of social media data by campaigns   always help tech savvy liberals and not their troglodytic rivals and the shock of discovering otherwise obscures the more important role that older forms of media played in making the trump era reality no doubt all the activity on facebook and the apparent use of facebook data had some impact somewhere on trump surprise victory but the media format that really made him president the one whose weaknesses and perversities and polarizing tendencies he brilliantly exploited wasn zuckerberg unreal kingdom it wasn even the twitter platform where trump struts and frets and rages daily it was that old pre internet standby broadcast and cable television and e ly tv news start with the fake news that laid the foundation for trump presidential campaign not the sort that circulates under clickbait headlines in your facebook feed but the sort broadcast in prime time by nbc under the label of reality tv yes as media sophisticates we re all supposed to know that reality means fake but in the beginning nobody marketed the apprentice that way across most of its run you saw much bankrupted real estate tycoon portrayed week after week and season after season as titan of industry the for serious greatest businessman in the world where did so many people originally get the idea that trump was the right guy to fix our manifestly broken government not from russian bots or targeted social media ad buys but from prime time show that sold itself as real and sold him as business genius forget unhappy blue collar heartlanders forget white nationalists and birthers the core trump demographic might just have been republicans who watched the apprentice who bought the fake news that his television program and its network sponsors gladly sold them that was step one in the trump hack of television media step two was the use of his celebrity to turn news channels into infomercials for his campaign yes his fame also boosted him on social media but there you can partially blame algorithms and the unwisdom of crowds with television news there were actual human beings charged with exercising news judgment and inclined to posture as civic minded actors when it suits them making the decision to hand day after day of free coverage to donald trump rallies outrages feuds and personal attacks nothing that cambridge analytica did to help the trump campaign target swing voters and there reason to think it didn do as much as it claimed had anything remotely like the impact of this alwaystrump tsunami which probably added up to more than billion in effective advertising for his campaign during the primary season flood that drowned all of his rivals pathetic tens of millions and as cynical as believe the lords of silicon valley to be the more important cynicism in belonged to those television execs who were fine with enabling the wild trumpian takeover of the because after all republicans deserved it and hillary was sure to beat him in the end except that she didn beat him in part because he also exploited the polarization that cable news in particular is designed to feed in this polarization didn just mean that fox became steadily more pro trump as he dispatched his rivals it also meant that network like cnn which thrives on team red vs team blue conflict felt compelled to turn airtime over to trump surrogates like jeffrey lord and corey lewandowski and kayleigh mcenany because their regular stable of conservative commentators was one of them simply wasn pro trump enough the depth and breadth of trump skepticism among right wing pundits was pretty solid indicator of his unfitness for high office but e ly once he won the nomination this skepticism was often filtered out of cable coverage because the important thing was to maintain the partisan shouting match model this in turn encouraged sense that this was just typical right versus left election in which you should vote for trump if you usually voted for republicans and in the end that what most voters did my own cnn experiences were positive admire the many fine journalists who work in television news but it was clear enough being in that orbit in as it should be clear to anyone who watched trump larger relationship to his television coverage that the business model of our news channels both assumes and heightens polarization and that it was ripe for exploitation by demagogue who was also celebrity it also clear as the economists levi boxell matthew gentzkow and jesse shapiro wrote in these pages late last year that among older white americans the core demographic where first the primaries and then the general election were decided television still far outstrips the internet as the most important source of news and indeed the three economists noted for all the talk about breitbart influence and russian meddling and dark web advertising trump only improved on mitt romney showing among americans who don use the internet and he actually lost support among internet using voters in sense you   argue all those tweets mattered mainly because they kept being quoted on tv which is not to say that the current freakout over facebook doesn make certain kind of sense beyond the psychological satisfaction of weaving the often genuinely sinister side of silicon valley into stolen election theories there strategic wisdom to the center left establishment focus on the internet what trump did will be hard for future demagogue to imitate the generations who get their information from newscasts are dying out the web is taking over at an accelerating pace and in the long run there is more to be gained in going after mark zuckerberg than in pillorying jeff zucker and pillorying fox hosts only helps their brand the big tech companies regard themselves as part of the liberal cultural complex so they re vulnerable to progressive bullying and shaming not so sean hannity whose stalwart support for trump was and remains vastly more important than any online stratagem in the end as michael brendan dougherty wrote recently for national review one implicit goal of the facebook freakout is to ensure that conservatives and populists will not be allowed to use the same tools as democrats and liberals again or at least not use them effectively if the trauma of trump victory turns social media gatekeepers into more aggressive and self conscious stewards of the liberal consensus the current freakout will have more than served its political purpose but like the television channels whose programming choices did far more than facebook to make donald trump president it won have served the truth invite you to follow me on twitter douthatnyt follow the

supported by media right wing media uses parkland shooting as conspiracy fodder by michael grynbaumfeb     the main   share this page     the main     david hogg year old student at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla has called on lawmakers to enact tougher restrictions on guns credit jonathan drake reuters the teenagers of marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who week ago lost of their classmates and school staff members in mass shooting have emerged as passionate advocates for reform speaking openly of their anger in the hope of forcing reckoning on guns but in certain right wing corners of the web and increasingly from more mainstream voices like rush limbaugh and commentator on cnn the students are being portrayed not as grief ridden survivors but as pawns and conspiracists intent on exploiting tragedy to undermine the nation laws in these baseless accounts which by tuesday had spread rapidly on social media the students are described as crisis actors who travel to the sites of shootings to instigate fury against guns or they are called plants defending the bureau for its failure to catch the shooter they have been portrayed as puppets being coached and manipulated by the democratic party gun control activists the so called antifa movement and the left wing billionaire george soros the theories are far fetched but they are finding broad and prominent audience online on tuesday the president son donald trump jr liked pair of tweets that accused david hogg year old who is among the most outspoken of the parkland students of criticizing the trump administration in an effort to protect his father whom mr hogg has described as retired agent advertisement     the main   mr hogg the high school student news director has become sensation

more sweeping condemnations alex jones the conspiracy theorist behind the site infowars suggested that the mass shooting was false flag orchestrated by anti gun groups mr limbaugh on his radio program

conspiracies wild and raw online are often pasteurized on their way into the mainstream subtler version of the theory appeared tuesday on the website of bill reilly the ousted fox news host mr reilly

conservative political action conference on thursday accused journalists of fawning over the sister of the north korean leader kim jong un he was far from the only speaker to attack the news media credit pete marovich for the   oxon hill md it did not seem like coincidence that the very first panel of this year conservative political action conference took direct aim at the state of journalism in the united states the opening session on thursday an affair to remember how the far left and the mainstream media got in bed together began with youtube style mash up of the year biggest media blunders the audience jeered joy behar of the view and jim acosta of cnn it whooped at clip of president trump thundering at mr acosta you are fake news this annual gathering is usually moment to hammer out what divides the fractious conservative movement what it has revealed so far is what unites it contempt for fakenews and the journalists that the former breitbart news writer ben shapiro memorably described as advocates of leftism masquerading as objective truth tellers mr shapiro provocateur with growing following among millennial conservatives brought the crowd to its feet when he declared the media are lying about you they are lying about me some attendees turned toward the reporters gathered in the back of hotel ballroom here and gave them taunting thumbs down advertisement     the main   but mr shapiro was far from the most prominent speaker whose fiery media criticism delighted the conservative faithful     the main   advertisement     the main   vice president mike pence accused journalists of fawning over the sister of the north korean leader kim jong un her sphinx like appearance beside mr pence at the winter olympics in south korea this month drew wide attention some commentators had criticized mr pence for remaining seated when the unified korean olympic team marched in the opening ceremony snub that they called disrespectful to american allies in south korea for all those in the media who think should have stood and cheered with the north koreans say the united states of america doesn stand with murderous dictatorships we stand up to murderous dictatorships mr pence said his words nearly drowned out by applause and cheers perhaps the most fervent anti media broadsides came from dana loesch the spokeswoman for the national rifle association who used her remarks to accuse news organizations of rooting for gun massacres many in legacy media love mass shootings ms loesch said eliciting nods and approving shouts addressing the reporters in the room she said you guys love it not saying that you love the tragedy but am saying that you love the ratings crying white mothers are ratings gold the incendiary dig was not much of surprise at

reaction from the audience perhaps sign of how the national outcry after the school shooting in parkland fla has become backdrop for this week gathering it was her media attacks that played best like when she said that she needed security detail to leave the televised cnn town hall with gun violence survivors where she spoke on wednesday night advertisement     the main   there were people rushing the stage and screaming burn her ms loesch said cnn spokesman said on thursday that the network security personnel accompanied all the town hall speakers including ms loesch from the stage and that ms loesch also had her own private security the spokesman did not say whether she had been threatened after ms loesch remarks on thursday some journalists chafed at the idea that they were exploiting the deaths of children the point of all of this is to say that people in the media aren real human beings with souls and families and feelings which is disgusting elise foley reporter at huffpost wrote on twitter the scorn toward journalists here reflected genuine concern from some attendees that mainstream news outlets willfully misunderstand conservatives several speakers expressed sense of victimhood that their beliefs were portrayed by reporters as intolerant or tantamount to bigotry and there were reminders that the media as punching bag trope among conservatives is tactic that shows few signs of going away they think it just because president trump is being mean to the media and we re all following trump mr shapiro said from the stage referring to his followers disdain toward the

advertisementopinionsupported bytrump hacked the media right before our eyesby ross douthatmarch imagewe never stopped watching credit andrew harrer bloomberglet get one thing straight am not fan of facebook confident that social media is cancer on our private lives and source of derangement in our politics take it for granted that the tech barons are acquiring the power to tilt elections and that they ll be happy to play handmaidens to tyrants soft and hard so long as they can monetize our data take certain mordant pleasure in watching mark zuckerberg and his minions scapegoated for the political failures of late obama era liberalism but the liberal establishment fixation on facebook sins first the transmission of fake news and now the exploitation of its data by the trump campaign or its appendages still feels like classic example of blaming something new because it new when it the old thing that mattered more or of blaming something new because you thought that new meant good that the use of social media data by campaigns   always help tech savvy liberals and not their troglodytic rivals and the shock of discovering otherwise obscures the more important role that older forms of media played in making the trump era reality no doubt all the activity on facebook and the apparent use of facebook data had some impact somewhere on trump surprise victory but the media format that really made him president the one whose weaknesses and perversities and polarizing tendencies he brilliantly exploited wasn zuckerberg unreal kingdom it wasn even the twitter platform where trump struts and frets and rages daily it was that old pre internet standby broadcast and cable television and e ly tv news start with the fake news that laid the foundation for trump presidential campaign not the sort that circulates under clickbait headlines in your facebook feed but the sort broadcast in prime time by nbc under the label of reality tv yes as media sophisticates we re all supposed to know that reality means fake but in the beginning nobody marketed the apprentice that way across most of its run you saw much bankrupted real estate tycoon portrayed week after week and season after season as titan of industry the for serious greatest businessman in the world where did so many people originally get the idea that trump was the right guy to fix our manifestly broken government not from russian bots or targeted social media ad buys but from prime time show that sold itself as real and sold him as business genius forget unhappy blue collar heartlanders forget white nationalists and birthers the core trump demographic might just have been republicans who watched the apprentice who bought the fake news that his television program and its network sponsors gladly sold them that was step one in the trump hack of television media step two was the use of his celebrity to turn news channels into infomercials for his campaign yes his fame also boosted him on social media but there you can partially blame algorithms and the unwisdom of crowds with television news there were actual human beings charged with exercising news judgment and inclined to posture as civic minded actors when it suits them making the decision to hand day after day of free coverage to donald trump rallies outrages feuds and personal attacks nothing that cambridge analytica did to help the trump campaign target swing voters and there reason to think it didn do as much as it claimed had anything remotely like the impact of this alwaystrump tsunami which probably added up to more than billion in effective advertising for his campaign during the primary season flood that drowned all of his rivals pathetic tens of millions and as cynical as believe the lords of silicon valley to be the more important cynicism in belonged to those television execs who were fine with enabling the wild trumpian takeover of the because after all republicans deserved it and hillary was sure to beat him in the end except that she didn beat him in part because he also exploited the polarization that cable news in particular is designed to feed in this polarization didn just mean that fox became steadily more pro trump as he dispatched his rivals it also meant that network like cnn which thrives on team red vs team blue conflict felt compelled to turn airtime over to trump surrogates like jeffrey lord and corey lewandowski and kayleigh mcenany because their regular stable of conservative commentators was one of them simply wasn pro trump enough the depth and breadth of trump skepticism among right wing pundits was pretty solid indicator of his unfitness for high office but e ly once he won the nomination this skepticism was often filtered out of cable coverage because the important thing was to maintain the partisan shouting match model this in turn encouraged sense that this was just typical right versus left election in which you should vote for trump if you usually voted for republicans and in the end that what most voters did my own cnn experiences were positive admire the many fine journalists who work in television news but it was clear enough being in that orbit in as it should be clear to anyone who watched trump larger relationship to his television coverage that the business model of our news channels both assumes and heightens polarization and that it was ripe for exploitation by demagogue who was also celebrity it also clear as the economists levi boxell matthew gentzkow and jesse shapiro wrote in these pages late last year that among older white americans the core demographic where first the primaries and then the general election were decided television still far outstrips the internet as the most important source of news and indeed the three economists noted for all the talk about breitbart influence and russian meddling and dark web advertising trump only improved on mitt romney showing among americans who don use the internet and he actually lost support among internet using voters in sense you   argue all those tweets mattered mainly because they kept being quoted on tv which is not to say that the current freakout over facebook doesn make certain kind of sense beyond the psychological satisfaction of weaving the often genuinely sinister side of silicon valley into stolen election theories there strategic wisdom to the center left establishment focus on the internet what trump did will be hard for future demagogue to imitate the generations who get their information from newscasts are dying out the web is taking over at an accelerating pace and in the long run there is more to be gained in going after mark zuckerberg than in pillorying jeff zucker and pillorying fox hosts only helps their brand the big tech companies regard themselves as part of the liberal cultural complex so they re vulnerable to progressive bullying and shaming not so sean hannity whose stalwart support for trump was and remains vastly more important than any online stratagem in the end as michael brendan dougherty wrote recently for national review one implicit goal of the facebook freakout is to ensure that conservatives and populists will not be allowed to use the same tools as democrats and liberals again or at least not use them effectively if the trauma of trump victory turns social media gatekeepers into more aggressive and self conscious stewards of the liberal consensus the current freakout will have more than served its political purpose but like

gripping narrative holiday has written one helluva page turner he documents how starting in the secretive thiel sought to take revenge on denton for outing him on gawker just because denton   and

dug up everything they   find about denton his colleagues at gawker gawker itself its parent company gawker media and some of the other people gawker offended they also needed novel legal theory about what denton had done figuring that the first amendment   protect denton and gawker when in october gawker made the momentous decision to publish without permission excerpts from sex tape involving hogan and his former best friend wife thiel not only had the perfect protagonist in an equally angry and determined hogan but also legal theory based on the idea that hogan privacy had been invaded as had thiel five years earlier unbeknown to denton and his company lawyers thiel had decided to bankroll hogan in his legal battle against gawker and denton in classic david and goliath fashion denton tragically underestimated his foes and paid the iron price as has been well documented elsewhere denton lost the five count lawsuit in florida courtroom and was slapped with million verdict gawker media had no choice but to file for bankruptcy its carcass was sold to the highest bidder to his considerable credit and for reasons that aren entirely made clear holiday decided to write conspiracy after both thiel and denton approached him separately wanting to share with him their views of the blockbuster case he less successful it seems to me in pushing his view throughout the book that thiel mr hogan and harder were involved in an old fashioned conspiracy in the stoical sense of the word to bring down denton and his crew yes they triumphed wildly and beyond anything they   have expected

about the riveting drama that conjoined in kind of bataan death march the unlikely trio of the silicon valley billionaire peter thiel the pro wrestling superstar hulk hogan terry bollea and the gawker

message about human nature or is he simply the master media manipulator he once proudly boasted to be in forbes is conspiracy profound masterwork by talented young writer or merely another pelt for the mantle on holiday acre ranch in bastrop county tex what clear is that holiday is an out of the box thinker who likes to take chances california native he quit the university of california riverside after his sophomore year to take year job at the collective hollywood talent agency he had turned summer internship into an offer of full time employment and was egged on by samantha hoover classmate and the woman who   become holiday wife was the kid who was going places he told the   in profile he apprenticed with the best selling author robert greene and before long american apparel the mostly defunct retail clothing chain lured holiday away to head the company public relations department in the middle of crisis its founder dov charney was accused of sexual assault holiday eventually resigned and american apparel filed for bankruptcy advertisement     the main   appalled and disillusioned holiday scored six figure advance to write an expos of the public relations game starting him on new career path of author journalist and hipster provocateur he and hoover lived together in los angeles new orleans and then new york city in they bought ranch near austin and started raising two chickens two goats biscuit and bucket and family by their brood had grown to include cattle three goats chickens ducks geese guinea hen and baby son holiday also has gauge shotgun caliber rifle bow and arrow and winchester that he keeps by his bed to ward off coyotes   holiday is the founder of brass check marketing and advisory firm with clients like google and the authors tony robbins tim ferriss and of course greene the name brass check is an example of holiday wit it refers both to upton sinclair account of the journalism industry and to slang for when bullet is in the chamber of semiautomatic pistol and ready to be fired he is also the media columnist for the new york observer owned by family trust associated with jared kushner he is years old conspiracy is his seventh book     the main   advertisement     the main   it is important for the book readers to be aware that holiday the college dropout is also huge believer in stoicism an ancient greek and roman philosophy that preaches suffering humility acceptance and endurance without complaint he became zealot while at college after   marcus aurelius meditations four   in row and then affixing his favorite passages from the book to the walls of his dorm room holiday is nothing if not erudite every time you turn around in conspiracy he is trying to make profound points by quoting from vast range of philosophers statesmen and great thinkers everyone from machiavelli and seneca to kierkegaard and george trow and on and on but incessant name dropping aside which tends to detract from his gripping narrative holiday has written one helluva page turner he documents how starting in the secretive thiel sought to take revenge on denton for outing him on gawker just because denton   and because he figured the news   generate the clicks and the kind of attention denton and his erstwhile enterprise craved thiel rightly offended began stealth campaign to punish denton for his callous and cavalier behavior   hulk hogan credit chris carlson associated press at chance meeting in germany thiel enlisted the help of someone holiday refers to only as mr and then charles harder the los angeles attorney who recently represented donald trump in his wildly unsuccessful legal effort to stop the publication of michael wolff fire and fury armed with million or so from thiel mr and harder dug up everything they   find about denton his colleagues at gawker gawker itself its parent company gawker media and some of the other people gawker offended they also needed novel legal theory about what denton had done figuring that the first amendment   protect denton and gawker when in october gawker made the momentous decision to publish without permission excerpts from sex tape involving hogan and his former best friend wife thiel not only had the perfect protagonist in an equally angry and determined hogan but also legal theory based on the idea that hogan privacy had been invaded as had thiel five years earlier unbeknown to denton and his company lawyers thiel had decided to bankroll hogan in his legal battle against gawker and denton in classic david and goliath fashion denton tragically underestimated his foes and paid the iron price as has been well documented elsewhere denton lost the five count lawsuit in florida courtroom and was slapped with million verdict gawker media had no choice but to file for bankruptcy its carcass was sold to the highest bidder to his considerable credit and for reasons that aren entirely made clear holiday decided to write conspiracy after both thiel and denton approached him separately wanting to share with him their views of the blockbuster case he less successful it seems to me in pushing his view throughout the book that thiel mr hogan and harder were involved in an old fashioned conspiracy in the stoical sense of the word to bring down denton and his crew yes they triumphed wildly and beyond anything they   have expected but  n that just be chalked up to having the better and more sympathetic legal argument rather than to having better tactics strategies and morally superior way of living of course this occam razor approach to the gawker case   not lend itself as easily to public relations mastermind skills conspiracy was embargoed for reasons that aren clear either much of its contents are already publicly

advertisementopinionsupported bytrump hacked the media right before our eyesby ross douthatmarch imagewe never stopped watching credit andrew harrer bloomberglet get one thing straight am not fan of facebook confident that social media is cancer on our private lives and source of derangement in our politics take it for granted that the tech barons are acquiring the power to tilt elections and that they ll be happy to play handmaidens to tyrants soft and hard so long as they can monetize our data take certain mordant pleasure in watching mark zuckerberg and his minions scapegoated for the political failures of late obama era liberalism but the liberal establishment fixation on facebook sins first the transmission of fake news and now the exploitation of its data by the trump campaign or its appendages still feels like classic example of blaming something new because it new when it the old thing that mattered more or of blaming something new because you thought that new meant good that the use of social media data by campaigns   always help tech savvy liberals and not their troglodytic rivals and the shock of discovering otherwise obscures the more important role that older forms of media played in making the trump era reality no doubt all the activity on facebook and the apparent use of facebook data had some impact somewhere on trump surprise victory but the media format that really made him president the one whose weaknesses and perversities and polarizing tendencies he brilliantly exploited wasn zuckerberg unreal kingdom it wasn even the twitter platform where trump struts and frets and rages daily it was that old pre internet standby broadcast and cable television and e ly tv news start with the fake news that laid the foundation for trump presidential campaign not the sort that circulates under clickbait headlines in your facebook feed but the sort broadcast in prime time by nbc under the label of reality tv yes as media sophisticates we re all supposed to know that reality means fake but in the beginning nobody marketed the apprentice that way across most of its run you saw much bankrupted real estate tycoon portrayed week after week and season after season as titan of industry the for serious greatest businessman in the world where did so many people originally get the idea that trump was the right guy to fix our manifestly broken government not from russian bots or targeted social media ad buys but from prime time show that sold itself as real and sold him as business genius forget unhappy blue collar heartlanders forget white nationalists and birthers the core trump demographic might just have been republicans who watched the apprentice who bought the fake news that his television program and its network sponsors gladly sold them that was step one in the trump hack of television media step two was the use of his celebrity to turn news channels into infomercials for his campaign yes his fame also boosted him on social media but there you can partially blame algorithms and the unwisdom of crowds with television news there were actual human beings charged with exercising news judgment and inclined to posture as civic minded actors when it suits them making the decision to hand day after day of free coverage to donald trump rallies outrages feuds and personal attacks nothing that cambridge analytica did to help the trump campaign target swing voters and there reason to think it didn do as much as it claimed had anything remotely like the impact of this alwaystrump tsunami which probably added up to more than billion in effective advertising for his campaign during the primary season flood that drowned all of his rivals pathetic tens of millions and as cynical as believe the lords of silicon valley to be the more important cynicism in belonged to those television execs who were fine with enabling the wild trumpian takeover of the because after all republicans deserved it and hillary was sure to beat him in the end except that she didn beat him in part because he also exploited the polarization that cable news in particular is designed to feed in this polarization didn just mean that fox became steadily more pro trump as he dispatched his rivals it also meant that network like cnn which thrives on team red vs team blue conflict felt compelled to turn airtime over to trump surrogates like jeffrey lord and corey lewandowski and kayleigh mcenany because their regular stable of conservative commentators was one of them simply wasn pro trump enough the depth and breadth of trump skepticism among right wing pundits was pretty solid indicator of his unfitness for high office but e ly once he won the nomination this skepticism was often filtered out of cable coverage because the important thing was to maintain the partisan shouting match model this in turn encouraged sense that this was just typical right versus left election in which you should vote for trump if you usually voted for republicans and in the end that what most voters did my own cnn experiences were positive admire the many fine journalists who work in television news but it was clear enough being in that orbit in as it should be clear to anyone who watched trump larger relationship to his television coverage that the business model of our news channels both assumes and heightens polarization and that it was ripe for exploitation by demagogue who was also celebrity it also clear as the economists levi boxell matthew gentzkow and jesse shapiro wrote in these pages late last year that among older white americans the core demographic where first the primaries and then the general election were decided television still far outstrips the internet as the most important source of news and indeed the three economists noted for all the talk about breitbart influence and russian meddling and dark web advertising trump only improved on mitt romney showing among americans who don use the internet and he actually lost support among internet using voters in sense you   argue all those tweets mattered mainly because they kept being quoted on tv which is not to say that the current freakout over facebook doesn make certain kind of sense beyond the psychological satisfaction of weaving the often genuinely sinister side of silicon valley into stolen election theories there strategic wisdom to the center left establishment focus on the internet what trump did will be hard for future demagogue to imitate the generations who get their information from newscasts are dying out the web is taking over at an accelerating pace and in the long run there is more to be gained in going after mark zuckerberg than in pillorying jeff zucker and pillorying fox hosts only helps their brand the big tech companies regard themselves as part of the liberal cultural complex so they re vulnerable to progressive bullying and shaming not so sean hannity whose stalwart support for trump was and remains vastly more important than any online stratagem in the end as michael brendan dougherty wrote recently for national review one implicit goal of the facebook freakout is to ensure that conservatives and populists will not be allowed to use the same tools as democrats and liberals again or at least not use them effectively if the trauma of trump victory turns social media gatekeepers into more aggressive and self conscious stewards of the liberal consensus the current freakout will have more than served its political purpose but like the television channels whose programming choices did far more than facebook to make donald trump president it won have served the truth invite you to follow me on twitter douthatnyt follow the

years ago the idea that for profit companies and foreign agents   use powerful data technologies to disrupt american democracy   have seemed laughable to most plotline from cold war espionage movie and the idea that the american system   be compromised enough to allow outside meddling with the most basic of its democratic functions the election of its leaders   have seemed even more absurd   we know that this is not fiction but fact it is secret so open that even its perpetrators seem halfhearted about hiding it data drives all that we do that is the motto emblazoned on the website of cambridge analytica the consulting firm that was employed by the trump campaign to influence voters and that is now under scrutiny for its unauthorized harvesting of data from at least million social media users the heart of cambridge analytica power is an enormous information ware  as many as data points on each of more than million americans according to recent reporting fact the company proudly confirms on its website its promise of elections driven by data ultimately implies vision of government steered not by people but by algorithms and by an expanding data mining culture operating without restrictions that such threats to democracy are now possible is due in part to the fact that our society lacks an information ethics adequate to its deepening dependence on data where politics is driven by data we need set of ethics to guide that data but in our rush to deliver on the promises of big data we have not sought one an adequate ethics of data for     include not only regulatory policy and statutory law governing matters like personal data privacy and implicit bias in algorithms it   also establish cultural expectations fortified by extensive education in high schools and colleges requiring us to think about data technologies as we build them not after they have already profiled categorized and otherwise informationalized millions of people students who will later turn their talents to the great challenges of data science   also be trained to consider the ethical design and use of the technologies they will someday unleash clearly we are not there high schoolers   may aspire to be the next mark zuckerberg but how many dream of designing ethical data technologies who   their role models even be executives at facebook twitter and amazon are among our celebrities   but how many data ethics advocates can the typical social media user name our approach to the ethics of data is wholly reactive investigations are conducted and apologies are extracted only after damage has been done and only in some instances mr zuckerberg seemed to take positive step on wednesday when he vowed to take action to better protect facebook user data we also made mistakes there more to do and we need to step up and do it he said in unsurprisingly facebook post this is like lashing rope around the cracking foundation of building what we need is for an ethics of data to be engineered right into the information skyscrapers being built   we need data ethics by design any good building must comply with complex array of codes standards and detailed studies of patterns of use by its eventual inhabitants but technical systems are   being built with minimal concern for compliance and total disregard for the downstream consequences of decades of identifiable data being collected on the babies being born into the most complicated information ecology that has ever existed mr zuckerberg and other silicon valley chiefs admitted in the wake of the election that their platforms needed fixing to help mitigate the bad actors who had exploited social media for political gain it is not mr zuckerberg fault that our society has given him free pass and net worth of billion for inventing his platform first and asking only later what its social consequences might be it is all of our faults thus however successful mr zuckerberg will be in making amends he will assuredly do almost nothing to prevent the next wunderkind from coming along and building the next killer app that will unleash who knows what before anybody even has chance to notice the challenge of designing ethics into data technologies is formidable this is in part because it requires overcoming century long ethos of data science develop first question later datafication first regulation afterward glimpse at the hi  of data science shows as much the techniques that cambridge analytica uses to produce its psychometric profiles are the cutting edge of data driven methodologies first devised years ago the science of personality research was born in that year in the midst of america fevered entry into war robert sessions woodworth of columbia university created the personal data sheet questionnaire that promised to assess the personalities of army recruits the war ended before woodworth psychological instrument was ready for deployment but the army had envisioned its use according to the precedent set by the intelligence tests it had been administering to new recruits under the direction of robert yerkes professor of psychology at harvard at the time the data these tests   produce   help decide who should go to the fronts who was fit to lead and who should stay well behind the lines the stakes of those wartime decisions were particularly stark but the aftermath of those psychometric instruments is even more unsettling as the century progressed such tests tests college placement exams predictive behavioral assessments   affect the lives of millions of americans schoolchildren who may have once or twice acted out in such way as to prompt psychometric evaluation   find themselves labeled setting them on an inescapable track through the education system researchers like woodworth and yerkes or their stanford colleague lewis terman who formalized the first sat did not anticipate the deep consequences of their work they were too busy pursuing the great intellectual challenges of their day much like mr zuckerberg in his pursuit of the next great social media platform or like cambridge analytica christopher wylie the twentysomething data scientist who helped build psychometric profiles of two thirds of all americans by leveraging personal information gained through uninformed consent all of these researchers were quite understandably obsessed with the great data science challenges of their generation their failure to consider the consequences of their pursuits however is not so much their fault as it is our collective failing for the past years we have been chasing visions of data with singular passion many of the best minds of each new generation have devoted themselves to delivering on the inspired data science promises of their day intelligence testing building the computer cracking the genetic code creating the internet and now this we have in the course of single century built an entire society economy and culture

advertisementopinionsupported bytrump hacked the media right before our eyesby ross douthatmarch imagewe never stopped watching credit andrew harrer bloomberglet get one thing straight am not fan of facebook confident that social media is cancer on our private lives and source of derangement in our politics take it for granted that the tech barons are acquiring the power to tilt elections and that they ll be happy to play handmaidens to tyrants soft and hard so long as they can monetize our data take certain mordant pleasure in watching mark zuckerberg and his minions scapegoated for the political failures of late obama era liberalism but the liberal establishment fixation on facebook sins first the transmission of fake news and now the exploitation of its data by the trump campaign or its appendages still feels like classic example of blaming something new because it new when it the old thing that mattered more or of blaming something new because you thought that new meant good that the use of social media data by campaigns   always help tech savvy liberals and not their troglodytic rivals and the shock of discovering otherwise obscures the more important role that older forms of media played in making the trump era reality no doubt all the activity on facebook and the apparent use of facebook data had some impact somewhere on trump surprise victory but the media format that really made him president the one whose weaknesses and perversities and polarizing tendencies he brilliantly exploited wasn zuckerberg unreal kingdom it wasn even the twitter platform where trump struts and frets and rages daily it was that old pre internet standby broadcast and cable television and e ly tv news start with the fake news that laid the foundation for trump presidential campaign not the sort that circulates under clickbait headlines in your facebook feed but the sort broadcast in prime time by nbc under the label of reality tv yes as media sophisticates we re all supposed to know that reality means fake but in the beginning nobody marketed the apprentice that way across most of its run you saw much bankrupted real estate tycoon portrayed week after week and season after season as titan of industry the for serious greatest businessman in the world where did so many people originally get the idea that trump was the right guy to fix our manifestly broken government not from russian bots or targeted social media ad buys but from prime time show that sold itself as real and sold him as business genius forget unhappy blue collar heartlanders forget white nationalists and birthers the core trump demographic might just have been republicans who watched the apprentice who bought the fake news that his television program and its network sponsors gladly sold them that was step one in the trump hack of television media step two was the use of his celebrity to turn news channels into infomercials for his campaign yes his fame also boosted him on social media but there you can partially blame algorithms and the unwisdom of crowds with television news there were actual human beings charged with exercising news judgment and inclined to posture as civic minded actors when it suits them making the decision to hand day after day of free coverage to donald trump rallies outrages feuds and personal attacks nothing that cambridge analytica did to help the trump campaign target swing voters and there reason to think it didn do as much as it claimed had anything remotely like the impact of this alwaystrump tsunami which probably added up to more than billion in effective advertising for his campaign during the primary season flood that drowned all of his rivals pathetic tens of millions and as cynical as believe the lords of silicon valley to be the more important cynicism in belonged to those television execs who were fine with enabling the wild trumpian takeover of the because after all republicans deserved it and hillary was sure to beat him in the end except that she didn beat him in part because he also exploited the polarization that cable news in particular is designed to feed in this polarization didn just mean that fox became steadily more pro trump as he dispatched his rivals it also meant that network like cnn which thrives on team red vs team blue conflict felt compelled to turn airtime over to trump surrogates like jeffrey lord and corey lewandowski and kayleigh mcenany because their regular stable of conservative commentators was one of them simply wasn pro trump enough the depth and breadth of trump skepticism among right wing pundits was pretty solid indicator of his unfitness for high office but e ly once he won the nomination this skepticism was often filtered out of cable coverage because the important thing was to maintain the partisan shouting match model this in turn encouraged sense that this was just typical right versus left election in which you should vote for trump if you usually voted for republicans and in the end that what most voters did my own cnn experiences were positive admire the many fine journalists who work in television news but it was clear enough being in that orbit in as it should be clear to anyone who watched trump larger relationship to his television coverage that the business model of our news channels both assumes and heightens polarization and that it was ripe for exploitation by demagogue who was also celebrity it also clear as the economists levi boxell matthew gentzkow and jesse shapiro wrote in these pages late last year that among older white americans the core demographic where first the primaries and then the general election were decided television still far outstrips the internet as the most important source of news and indeed the three economists noted for all the talk about breitbart influence and russian meddling and dark web advertising trump only improved on mitt romney showing among americans who don use the internet and he actually lost support among internet using voters in sense you   argue all those tweets mattered mainly because they kept being quoted on tv which is not to say that the current freakout over facebook doesn make certain kind of sense beyond the psychological satisfaction of weaving the often genuinely sinister side of silicon valley into stolen election theories there strategic wisdom to the center left establishment focus on the internet what trump did will be hard for future demagogue to imitate the generations who get their information from newscasts are dying out the web is taking over at an accelerating pace and in the long run there is more to be gained in going after mark zuckerberg than in pillorying jeff zucker and pillorying fox hosts only helps their brand the big tech companies regard themselves as part of the liberal cultural complex so they re vulnerable to progressive bullying and shaming not so sean hannity whose stalwart support for trump was and remains vastly more important than any online stratagem in the end as michael brendan dougherty wrote recently for national review one implicit goal of the facebook freakout is to ensure that conservatives and populists will not be allowed to use the same tools as democrats and liberals again or at least not use them effectively if the trauma of trump victory turns social media gatekeepers into more aggressive and self conscious stewards of the liberal consensus the current freakout will have more than served its political purpose but like

years ago the idea that for profit companies and foreign agents   use powerful data technologies to disrupt american democracy   have seemed laughable to most plotline from cold war espionage movie and the idea that the american system   be compromised enough to allow outside meddling with the most basic of its democratic functions the election of its leaders   have seemed even more absurd   we know that this is not fiction but fact it is secret so open that even its perpetrators seem halfhearted about hiding it data drives all that we do that is the motto emblazoned on the website of cambridge analytica the consulting firm that was employed by the trump campaign to influence voters and that is now under scrutiny for its unauthorized harvesting of data from at least million social media users the heart of cambridge analytica power is an enormous information ware  as many as data points on each of more than million americans according to recent reporting fact the company proudly confirms on its website its promise of elections driven by data ultimately implies vision of government steered not by people but by algorithms and by an expanding data mining culture operating without restrictions that such threats to democracy are now possible is due in part to the fact that our society lacks an information ethics adequate to its deepening dependence on data where politics is driven by data we need set of ethics to guide that data but in our rush to deliver on the promises of big data we have not sought one an adequate ethics of data for     include not only regulatory policy and statutory law governing matters like personal data privacy and implicit bias in algorithms it   also establish cultural expectations fortified by extensive education in high schools and colleges requiring us to think about data technologies as we build them not after they have already profiled categorized and otherwise informationalized millions of people students who will later turn their talents to the great challenges of data science   also be trained to consider the ethical design and use of the technologies they will someday unleash clearly we are not there high schoolers   may aspire to be the next mark zuckerberg but how many dream of designing ethical data technologies who   their role models even be executives at facebook twitter and amazon are among our celebrities   but how many data ethics advocates can the typical social media user name our approach to the ethics of data is wholly reactive investigations are conducted and apologies are extracted only after damage has been done and only in some instances mr zuckerberg seemed to take positive step on wednesday when he vowed to take action to better protect facebook user data we also made mistakes there more to do and we need to step up and do it he said in unsurprisingly facebook post this is like lashing rope around the cracking foundation of building what we need is for an ethics of data to be engineered right into the information skyscrapers being built   we need data ethics by design any good building must comply with complex array of codes standards and detailed studies of patterns of use by its eventual inhabitants but technical systems are   being built with minimal concern for compliance and total disregard for the downstream consequences of decades of identifiable data being collected on the babies being born into the most complicated information ecology that has ever existed mr zuckerberg and other silicon valley chiefs admitted in the wake of the election that their platforms needed fixing to help mitigate the bad actors who had exploited social media for political gain it is not mr zuckerberg fault that our society has given him free pass and net worth of billion for inventing his platform first and asking only later what its social consequences might be it is all of our faults thus however successful mr zuckerberg will be in making amends he will assuredly do almost nothing to prevent the next wunderkind from coming along and building the next killer app that will unleash who knows what before anybody even has chance to notice the challenge of designing ethics into data technologies is formidable this is in part because it requires overcoming century long ethos of data science develop first question later datafication first regulation afterward glimpse at the hi  of data science shows as much the techniques that cambridge analytica uses to produce its psychometric profiles are the cutting edge of data driven methodologies first devised years ago the science of personality research was born in that year in the midst of america fevered entry into war robert sessions woodworth of columbia university created the personal data sheet questionnaire that promised to assess the personalities of army recruits the war ended before woodworth psychological instrument was ready for deployment but the army had envisioned its use according to the precedent set by the intelligence tests it had been administering to new recruits under the direction of robert yerkes professor of psychology at harvard at the time the data these tests   produce   help decide who should go to the fronts who was fit to lead and who should stay well behind the lines the stakes of those wartime decisions were particularly stark but the aftermath of those psychometric instruments is even more unsettling as the century progressed such tests tests college placement exams predictive behavioral assessments   affect the lives of millions of americans schoolchildren who may have once or twice acted out in such way as to prompt psychometric evaluation   find themselves labeled setting them on an inescapable track through the education system researchers like woodworth and yerkes or their stanford colleague lewis terman who formalized the first sat did not anticipate the deep consequences of their work they were too busy pursuing the great intellectual challenges of their day much like mr zuckerberg in his pursuit of the next great social media platform or like cambridge analytica christopher wylie the twentysomething data scientist who helped build psychometric profiles of two thirds of all americans by leveraging personal information gained through uninformed consent all of these researchers were quite understandably obsessed with the great data science challenges of their generation their failure to consider the consequences of their pursuits however is not so much their fault as it is our collective failing for the past years we have been chasing visions of data with singular passion many of the best minds of each new generation have devoted themselves to delivering on the inspired data science promises of their day intelligence testing building the computer cracking the genetic code creating the internet and now this we have in the course of single century built an entire society economy and culture that runs on information yet we have hardly begun to engineer data ethics appropriate for our extraordinary information carnival if we do not do so soon data will drive democracy and we may well lose

masquerading as objective truth tellers mr shapiro provocateur with growing following among millennial conservatives brought the crowd to its feet when he declared the media are lying about you they are lying about me some attendees turned toward the reporters gathered in the back of hotel ballroom here and gave them taunting thumbs down but mr shapiro was far from the most prominent speaker

appearance beside mr pence at the winter olympics in south korea this month drew wide attention some commentators had criticized mr pence for remaining seated when the unified korean olympic team

united states of america doesn stand with murderous dictatorships we stand up to murderous dictatorships mr pence said his words nearly drowned out by applause and cheers perhaps the most fervent anti media broadsides came from dana loesch the spokeswoman for the national rifle association who used her remarks to accuse news organizations of rooting for gun massacres many in legacy media love mass shootings ms loesch said eliciting nods and approving shouts addressing the reporters in the room she said you guys love it not saying that you love the tragedy but am saying that you love the ratings crying white mothers are ratings gold the incendiary dig was not much of surprise at conference that attracts wide spectrum of right wing groups and news outlets many of which have honed the provocation of liberals into fine and some  profitable art still some of ms loesch other remarks reiterating the arguments for defending the second amendment and calling for more guns in schools drew more tepid reaction from the audience perhaps sign of how the national outcry after the school shooting in parkland fla has become backdrop for this week gathering it was her media attacks that played best like when she said that she needed security detail to leave the televised cnn town hall with gun violence survivors where she spoke on wednesday night there were people rushing the stage and screaming burn her ms loesch said cnn spokesman said on thursday that the network security personnel accompanied all the town hall speakers including ms loesch from the stage and that ms loesch also had her own private security the spokesman did not say whether she had been threatened after ms loesch remarks on thursday some journalists chafed at the idea that they were exploiting the deaths of children the point of all of this is to say that people in the media aren real human beings with souls and families and feelings which is disgusting elise foley reporter at huffpost wrote on twitter the scorn toward journalists here reflected genuine concern from some attendees that mainstream news outlets willfully misunderstand conservatives several speakers expressed sense of victimhood that their beliefs were portrayed by reporters as intolerant or tantamount to bigotry and there were reminders that the media as punching bag trope among conservatives is tactic that shows few signs of going away they think it just because president trump is being mean to the media and we re all following trump mr shapiro said from the stage referring to his followers disdain toward the press no he

sitting in parliament in canberra monday feb joyce quit as party leader and deputy prime minister over sexual harassment allegation creditrod mcguirk associated pressmelbourne australia australian politics these days feels like   in people magazine political journalism indeed parliament itself has been reduced to forum for rumors about sex it all began in february with the sensational news that barnaby joyce then deputy prime minister had been having an affair with an aide who is now pregnant eventually mr joyce resigned from his leadership post and retreated to the backbench but the government response to the scandal ensured it   linger on having initially insisted that mr joyce predicament was private matter prime minister malcolm turnbull swiftly changed his view and introduced formal ban on sex between ministers and their staff this might seem like straightforward acknowledgment of the power imbalances within government official office but in truth it has meant that what might have been footnote in australian political hi  has instead set off the degradation of the country political culture consensual sexual relationship between minister and staff member has become firing offense like corruption or conflict of interest every rumor of intra office sex is now fair game for inquiry from the press and parliament sex is now officially matter of public interest this   only have deleterious effect on politics and sure enough that what has happened days after mr joyce resignation michaelia cash the minister for jobs and innovation from the conservative liberal party was being interrogated in hearing unrelated to the joyce scandal or intra office sex when she declared that bill shorten leader of the opposition labor party has been the subject of rumors for years concerning presumably sexual relationships with his female staff members this outburst   only have occurred in the context of the joyce matter the home affairs minister peter dutton made this explicit when he defended ms cash in radio interview we ve sat here taking morals lecture from bill shorten in relation to barnaby joyce over the last few weeks and people know that there hi  of problems in bill shorten personal life he said and to be lectured by the labor party really sticks in the craw but the truth is that the morals lecture came from mr turnbull labor response throughout mr joyce travails has been studiously amoral focused on questions of whether his relationship had led him to abuse public funds or whether the prime minister approved the transfer of mr joyce former employee to other ministerial offices only when the prime minister made the affair itself civil wrong by changing the office code of conduct for ministers did he make ms cash comments politically meaningful smear the real problem here is not that ms cash and mr joyce exercised poor judgment politicians have been doing that for centuries it that within this new political culture mr joyce   expect punishment for consensual affair and that ms cash was saying something squarely relevant every political journalist now has duty to explore sexual rumors and politicians have duty to investigate them in just the past few days we ve seen the national party of australia decide to quiz prospective candidates about their sex lives including visits to brothels or swingers clubs and any relationships that   compromise them if they became public mr turnbull attempt to deal with the power imbalances inherent between ministers and their staff was probably well intentioned and concern about sex and power in ministers offices is utterly reasonable but we can regulate office sexual conduct in way that doesn transform sexual behavior into matter of public interest any rules will be impossible to police except through the most corrosive and intrusive means and that is before we even consider that to impose ban like this is to dismiss the agency of the staff members and it ignores the many perfectly sound relationships to come from such unbalanced circumstances already one independent member of parliament is proposing that the ban on office sex cover all politicians not just ministers but why stop there there is often power imbalance between people of different ages should we start regulating relationships characterized by an age gap or relationships characterized by class disparity it is unlikely that mr turnbull will ever reverse the sex ban he has taken too strong moral stand on it and the ban has enough public support to make revisiting it risky political move even the labor party which had criticized the policy wound up pledging to keep it if it takes control of the government that is shame policy that makes office sex legitimate focus of journalistic and even

pulling women up quota laws for female legislative candidates have created opportunities for women to advance in politics but they have not fully transformed traditional attitudes about who should lead country women entered national congresses in significant numbers thanks to gender quotas argentina passed the world first quota law for female candidates for congress in requiring political parties to nominate women for at least percent of the open positions it was recently updated so that half of parties congressional slates must be women   all but two latin american countries have quota or parity law for legislative candidates women hold more than percent of legislative seats in costa rica ecuador mexico and nicaragua bolivia has majority female legislature in the united states by comparison women make up just percent of the   of representatives and percent of the senate many of these quota laws do more than increase the number of female candidates many require political parties to place women in favorable ballot positions and to allocate portions of their budget to training female leaders but while affirmative action laws help women get ahead they do not save them from political crises ms bachelet mrs kirchner ms rousseff and ms chinchilla led popular incumbent parties when they were elected president in region already accustomed to female leaders the three presidents on the left ms bachelet mrs kirchner and ms rousseff also benefited from the pink tide wave of leftist leadership that swept latin america from to in this period the region was buoyed by commodities boom flush with resources countries expanded social protections for workers the poor indigenous peoples people and women then the party ended economies declined and security concerns increased citizens became disillusioned and the traditional parties and their coalitions broke apart voters decided to throw most incumbents out men and women alike but the women fell harder than the men making clear that there is still double standard for male and female leaders ms chinchilla presidency was widely seen as failure even though the economy grew percent to percent during her term ms bachelet favorability nose dived following allegations that her son and daughter in law profited illicitly from real estate while president elect sebasti pi era apparently suffered no ill effects from allegations that he faked invoices to illegally finance campaign in congress impeached ms rousseff and removed her from her office for accounting practices that were long held as normal in brazil and with no evidence of her personal enrichment upon taking over from ms rousseff president michel temer chose only white men for his new cabinet in country where nonwhites are the majority mr temer recently faced accusations of corruption more serious than those against ms rousseff including allegations that he ordered his subordinates to pay hush money he survived his impeachment vote neither the left nor the right in latin america   to want female candidates these days the left favored to win after ms chinchilla departure in costa rica passed over the longtime political leader epsy campbell barr prominent politician of african descent ms campbell barr lost her bid for the party nomination for president despite having approval ratings higher than those of her male competitors and on the right the mexican politician and former first lady margarita zavala had strong poll numbers but no path to winning the nomination she recently started an independent campaign for the presidency in video criticizing the party for closing ranks against her these are not isolated events my research shows that political parties from the left and right nominate fewer women when voters think the economy is doing poorly political parties on both sides also nominate fewer women when there is increased competition in latin america disillusionment has fueled the growth of new parties more choices for voters means fewer seats for each party and parties with fewer seats to win appear less likely to take chances on women more women in office also does not mean less discrimination or harassment the glass ceiling remains while latin america outpaces the global average for women in senior management roles women hold only percent of board seats in six of latin america largest economies within legislatures women rarely lead their parties delegations and they remain absent from the most prestigious committees in colombia study found that nearly quarter of female elected officials felt silenced and were denied resources by their parties and percent of female mayors reported sexist treatment some  resistance to female politicians takes violent forms parties have long undermined quotas by asking women to resign once elected juana quispe councilwoman in bolivia was beaten to death for refusing to do so gender and parity laws matter and they have too much public support for politicians to roll them back even conservative chile now has gender quota for the legislature which almost doubled the number of women in congress in the election where the right made huge comeback but ending the sexism and hostility that drives women from power requires changing cultural attitudes and ending impunity toward violence against women costa rica has tackled traditional notions about who should lead by applying quotas to the civil society sector by law nonprofit organizations must have gender parity in their top leadership positions this includes charitable humanitarian and social service organizations bringing men into positions from which they ve historically been absent after all if more women take power in politics and business men will need something else to do jennifer

the gender gap in political leadership but to hold these gains and to help ensure that women   to rise to top political positions latin america needs to understand the limits of legal remedies for pulling women up quota laws for female legislative candidates have created opportunities for women to advance in politics but they have not fully transformed traditional attitudes about who should lead country women entered national congresses in significant numbers thanks to gender quotas argentina passed the world first quota law for female candidates for congress in requiring political parties to nominate women for at least percent of the open positions it was recently updated so that half of parties congressional slates must be women   all but two latin american countries have quota or parity law for legislative candidates women hold more than percent of legislative seats in costa rica ecuador mexico and nicaragua bolivia has majority female legislature in the united states by comparison women make up just percent of the   of representatives and percent of the senate many of these quota laws do more than increase the number of female candidates many require political parties to place women in favorable ballot positions and to allocate portions of their budget to training female leaders but while affirmative action laws help women get ahead they do not save them from political crises ms bachelet mrs kirchner ms rousseff and ms chinchilla led popular incumbent parties when they were elected president in region already accustomed to female leaders the three presidents on the left ms bachelet mrs kirchner and ms rousseff also benefited from the pink tide wave of leftist leadership that swept latin america from to in this period the region was buoyed by commodities boom flush with resources countries expanded social protections for workers the poor indigenous peoples people and women then the party ended economies declined and security concerns increased citizens became disillusioned and the traditional parties and their coalitions broke apart voters decided to throw most incumbents out men and women alike but the women fell harder than the men making clear that there is still double standard for male and female leaders ms chinchilla presidency was widely seen as failure even though the economy grew percent to percent during her term ms bachelet favorability nose dived following allegations that her son and daughter in law profited illicitly from real estate while president elect sebasti pi era apparently suffered no ill effects from allegations that he faked invoices to illegally finance campaign in congress impeached ms rousseff and removed her from her office for accounting practices that were long held as normal in brazil and with no evidence of her personal enrichment upon taking over from ms rousseff president michel temer chose only white men for his new cabinet in country where nonwhites are the majority mr temer recently faced accusations of corruption more serious than those against ms rousseff including allegations that he ordered his subordinates to pay hush money he survived his impeachment vote neither

campbell barr prominent politician of african descent ms campbell barr lost her bid for the party nomination for president despite having approval ratings higher than those of her male competitors and on the right the mexican politician and former first lady margarita zavala had strong poll numbers but no path to winning the nomination she recently started an independent campaign for the presidency in video criticizing the party for closing ranks against her these are not isolated events my research shows that political parties from the left and right nominate fewer women when voters think the economy is doing poorly political parties on both sides also nominate fewer women when there is increased competition in latin america disillusionment has fueled the growth of new parties more choices for voters means fewer seats for each party and parties with fewer seats to win appear less likely to take chances on women more women in office also does not mean less discrimination or harassment the glass ceiling remains while latin america outpaces the global average for women in senior management roles women hold only percent of board seats in six of latin america largest economies within legislatures women rarely lead their parties delegations and they remain absent from the most prestigious committees in colombia study found that nearly quarter of female elected officials felt silenced and were denied resources by their parties and percent of female mayors reported sexist treatment some  resistance to female politicians takes violent forms parties have long undermined

advertisementopinionsupported byop ed contributorlatin america female leadership voidby jennifer piscopofeb leer en espa olimagecreditsarah mazzettisantiago chile after president michelle bachelet of chile leaves office in march latin america will have no female presidents there was time in when the region had four laura chinchilla in costa rica cristina fern ndez de kirchner in argentina dilma rousseff in brazil and ms bachelet now latin america is left with few prospects for female presidents in the near future more than most regions latin america has used affirmative action laws to close the gender gap in political leadership but to hold these gains and to help ensure that women   to rise to top political positions latin america needs to understand the limits of legal remedies for pulling women up quota laws for female legislative candidates have created opportunities for women to advance in politics but they have not fully transformed traditional attitudes about who should lead country women entered national congresses in significant numbers thanks to gender quotas argentina passed the world first quota law for female candidates for congress in requiring political parties to nominate women for at least percent of the open positions it was recently updated so that half of parties congressional slates must be women   all but two latin american countries have quota or parity law for legislative candidates women hold more than percent of legislative seats in costa rica ecuador mexico and nicaragua bolivia has majority female legislature in the united states by comparison women make up just percent of the   of representatives and percent of the senate many of these quota laws do more than increase the number of female candidates many require political parties to place women in favorable ballot positions and to allocate portions of their budget to training female leaders but while affirmative action laws help women get ahead they do not save them from political crises ms bachelet mrs kirchner ms rousseff and ms chinchilla led popular incumbent parties when they were elected president in region already accustomed to female leaders the three presidents on the left ms bachelet mrs kirchner and ms rousseff also benefited from the pink tide wave of leftist leadership that swept latin america from to in this period the region was buoyed by commodities boom flush with resources countries expanded social protections for workers the poor indigenous peoples people and women then the party ended economies declined and security concerns increased citizens became disillusioned and the traditional parties and their coalitions broke apart voters decided to throw most incumbents out men and women alike but the women fell harder than the men making clear that there is still double standard for male and female leaders ms chinchilla presidency was widely seen as failure even though the economy grew percent to percent during her term ms bachelet favorability nose dived following allegations that her son and daughter in law profited illicitly from real estate while president elect sebasti pi era apparently suffered no ill effects from allegations that he faked invoices to illegally finance campaign in congress impeached ms rousseff and removed her from her office for accounting practices that were long held as normal in brazil and with no evidence of her personal enrichment upon taking over from ms rousseff president michel temer chose only white men for his new cabinet in country where nonwhites are the majority mr temer recently faced accusations of corruption more serious than those against ms rousseff including allegations that he ordered his subordinates to pay hush money he survived his impeachment vote neither the left nor the right in latin america   to want female candidates these days the left favored to win after ms chinchilla departure in costa rica passed over the longtime political leader epsy campbell barr prominent politician of african descent ms campbell barr lost her bid for the party nomination for president despite having approval ratings higher than those of her male competitors and on the right the mexican politician and former first lady margarita zavala had strong poll numbers but no path to winning the nomination she recently started an independent campaign for the presidency in video criticizing the party for closing ranks against her these are not isolated events my research shows that political parties from the left and right nominate fewer women when voters think the economy is doing poorly political parties on both sides also nominate fewer women when there is increased competition in latin america disillusionment has fueled the growth of new parties more choices for voters means fewer seats for each party and parties with fewer seats to win appear less likely to take chances on women more women in office also does not mean less discrimination or harassment the glass ceiling remains while latin america outpaces the global average for women in senior management roles women hold only percent of board seats in six of latin america largest economies within legislatures women rarely lead their parties delegations and they remain absent from the most prestigious committees in colombia study found that nearly quarter of female elected officials felt silenced and were denied resources by their parties and percent of female mayors reported sexist treatment some  resistance to female politicians takes violent forms parties have long undermined

chile leaves office in march latin america will have no female presidents there was time in when the region had four laura chinchilla in costa rica cristina fern ndez de kirchner in argentina dilma rousseff in brazil and ms bachelet now latin america is left with few prospects for female presidents in the near future more than most regions latin america has used affirmative action laws to close the gender gap in political leadership but to hold these gains and to help ensure that women   to rise to top political positions latin america needs to understand the limits of legal remedies for pulling women up quota laws for female legislative candidates have created opportunities for women to advance in politics but they have not fully transformed traditional attitudes about who should lead country women entered national congresses in significant numbers thanks to gender quotas argentina passed the world first quota law for female candidates for congress in requiring political parties to nominate women for at least percent of the open positions it was recently updated so that half of parties congressional slates must be women   all but two latin american countries have quota or parity law for legislative candidates women hold more than percent of legislative seats in costa rica ecuador mexico and nicaragua bolivia has majority female legislature in the united states by comparison women make up just percent of the   of representatives and percent of the senate many of these quota laws do more than increase the number of female candidates many require political parties to place women in favorable ballot positions and to allocate portions of their budget to training female leaders but while affirmative action laws help women get ahead they do not save them from political crises ms bachelet mrs kirchner ms rousseff and ms chinchilla led popular incumbent parties when they were elected president in region already accustomed to female leaders the three presidents on the left ms bachelet mrs kirchner and ms rousseff also benefited from the pink tide wave of leftist leadership that swept latin america from to in this period the region was buoyed by commodities boom flush with resources countries expanded social protections for workers the poor indigenous peoples people and women then the party ended economies declined and security concerns increased citizens became disillusioned and the traditional parties and their coalitions broke apart voters decided to throw most incumbents out men and women alike but the women fell harder than the men making clear that there is still double standard for male and female leaders ms chinchilla presidency was widely seen as failure even though the economy grew percent to percent during her term ms bachelet favorability nose dived following allegations that her son and daughter in law profited illicitly from real estate while president elect sebasti pi era apparently suffered no ill effects from allegations that he faked invoices to illegally finance campaign in congress impeached ms rousseff and removed her from her office for accounting practices that were long held as normal in brazil and with no evidence of her personal enrichment upon taking over from ms rousseff president michel temer chose only white men for his new cabinet in country where nonwhites are the majority mr temer recently faced accusations of corruption more serious than those against ms rousseff including allegations that he ordered his subordinates to pay hush money he survived his impeachment vote neither the left nor the right in latin america   to want female candidates these days the left favored to win after ms chinchilla departure in costa rica passed over the longtime political leader epsy campbell barr prominent politician of african descent ms campbell barr lost her bid for the party nomination for president despite having approval ratings higher than those of her male competitors and on the right the mexican politician and former first lady margarita zavala had strong poll numbers but no path to winning the nomination she recently started an independent campaign for the presidency in video criticizing the party for closing ranks against her these are not isolated events my research shows that political parties from the left and right nominate fewer women when voters think the economy is doing poorly political parties on both sides also nominate fewer women when there is increased competition in latin america disillusionment has fueled the growth of new parties more choices for voters means fewer seats for each party and parties with fewer seats to win appear less likely to take chances on women more women in office also does not mean less discrimination or harassment the glass ceiling remains while latin america outpaces the global average for women in senior management roles women hold only percent of board seats in six of latin america largest economies within legislatures women rarely lead their parties delegations and they remain absent from the most prestigious committees in colombia study found that nearly quarter of female elected officials felt silenced and were denied resources by their parties and percent of female mayors reported sexist treatment some  resistance to female politicians takes violent forms parties have long undermined quotas by asking women to resign once elected juana quispe councilwoman in bolivia was beaten to death for refusing to do so gender and parity laws matter and they have too much public support for politicians to roll them back even conservative chile now has gender quota for the legislature which almost doubled the number of women in congress in the election where the right made huge comeback but ending the sexism and hostility that drives women from power requires changing cultural attitudes and ending impunity toward violence against women costa rica has tackled traditional notions about who should lead by applying quotas to the civil society sector by law nonprofit organizations must have gender parity in their top leadership positions this includes charitable humanitarian and social service organizations bringing men into positions from which they ve historically been absent after all if more women take power in politics and business men will need something else to do jennifer

lombardy the wealthy northern region that includes this fashionable city in landslide but pull up the league campaign manifesto dig past the strident anti immigration and anti muslim rhetoric and suddenly the tone turns more poetic italy and its thousand cultures should be the silicon valley of cultural heritage it sings one of many flourishes among the party proposals for art institutions

sitting in parliament in canberra monday feb joyce quit as party leader and deputy prime minister over sexual harassment allegation creditrod mcguirk associated pressmelbourne australia australian politics these days feels like   in people magazine political journalism indeed parliament itself has been reduced to forum for rumors about sex it all began in february with the sensational news that barnaby joyce then deputy prime minister had been having an affair with an aide who is now pregnant eventually mr joyce resigned from his leadership post and retreated to the backbench but the government response to the scandal ensured it   linger on having initially insisted that mr joyce predicament was private matter prime minister malcolm turnbull swiftly changed his view and introduced formal ban on sex between ministers and their staff this might seem like straightforward acknowledgment of the power imbalances within government official office but in truth it has meant that what might have been footnote in australian political hi  has instead set off the degradation of the country political culture consensual sexual relationship between minister and staff member has become firing offense like corruption or conflict of interest every rumor of intra office sex is now fair game for inquiry from the press and parliament sex is now officially matter of public interest this   only have deleterious effect on politics and sure enough that what has happened days after mr joyce resignation michaelia cash the minister for jobs and innovation from the conservative liberal party was being interrogated in hearing unrelated to the joyce scandal or intra office sex when she declared that bill shorten leader of the opposition labor party has been the subject of rumors for years concerning presumably sexual relationships with his female staff members this outburst   only have occurred in the context of the joyce matter the home affairs minister peter dutton made this explicit when he defended ms cash in radio interview we ve sat here taking morals lecture from bill shorten in relation to barnaby joyce over the last few weeks and people know that there hi  of problems in bill shorten personal life he said and to be lectured by the labor party really sticks in the craw but the truth is that the morals lecture came from mr turnbull labor response throughout mr joyce travails has been studiously amoral focused on questions of whether his relationship had led him to abuse public funds or whether the prime minister approved the transfer of mr joyce former employee to other ministerial offices only when the prime minister made the affair itself civil wrong by changing the office code of conduct for ministers did he make ms cash comments politically meaningful smear the real problem here is not that ms cash and mr joyce exercised poor judgment politicians have been doing that for centuries it that within this new political culture mr joyce   expect punishment for consensual affair and that ms cash was saying something squarely relevant every political journalist now has duty to explore sexual rumors and politicians have duty to investigate them in just the past few days we ve seen the national party of australia decide to quiz prospective candidates about their sex lives including visits to brothels or swingers clubs and any relationships that   compromise them if they became public mr turnbull attempt to deal with the power imbalances inherent between ministers and their staff was probably well intentioned and concern about sex and power in ministers offices is utterly reasonable but we can regulate office sexual conduct in way that doesn transform sexual behavior into matter of public interest any rules will be impossible to police except through the most corrosive and intrusive means and that is before we even consider that to impose ban like this is to dismiss the agency of the staff members and it ignores the many perfectly sound relationships to come from such unbalanced circumstances already one independent member of parliament is proposing that the ban on office sex cover all politicians not just ministers but why stop there there is often power imbalance between people of different ages should we start regulating relationships characterized by an age gap or relationships characterized by class disparity it is unlikely that mr turnbull will ever reverse the sex ban he has taken too strong moral stand on it and the ban has enough public support to make revisiting it risky political move even the labor party which had criticized the policy wound up pledging to keep it if it takes control of the government that is shame policy that makes office sex legitimate focus of journalistic and even political energy promises to do major disservice in the long run australian politics might have become little more sensationalistic through all this and it has gotten little smaller too waleed aly is

horizontal snow in the nor easter last week for starters donald trump had won the district by points in the district has been held by republicans for most of the last years conservative super pacs were willing to spend millions it ended up being around million to buy tv time to savage mr lamb the incumbent tim murphy conservative anti abortion republican had lock on re election until the pittsburgh post gazette reported last year that he had urged his mistress to have an abortion republican   leaders decided that mr murphy had to go he resigned in october the man republicans chose as their candidate was rick saccone jurassic era conservative who boasted that he was trump before trump was trump that apparently was few trumps too many for voters in the th which begins in the pittsburgh suburbs and slithers its way in classic gerrymandering fashion through conservative small towns and rural areas toward the west virginia border it no wonder that mr saccone entered the race as the favorite this race was mr saccone to lose and darned if he didn absentee ballots still must be counted but mr lamb held lead of just under votes enough for him to declare victory early wednesday the news media was more cautious but if the absentee ballots match the split of the vote at the polls mr lamb narrow lead will shrink but hold the problem with political campaigns is that they don exist in theory but in fact factors like the candidate personality can carry weight as does the effectiveness of his field effort and advertising and lest we forget his position on the issues imagea supporter held up lamb cutout at an election night rally in canonsburg pennsylvania creditdrew angerer getty imagesmr saccone was wet blanket of candidate without scintilla of charisma he also didn particularly care for campaigning organized few public rallies and rarely took to the streets to speak with voters he let the super pacs do the talking for him with saturation tv ads while mr

national or even cosmic trends in analyzing mr lamb victory before you get try to put too much theory into voters minds think all the credit should go to conor lamb mr kopas said there is no

which he spent five minutes urging the crowd to support mr saccone and minutes talking about himself if mr saccone prided himself on being trump clone mr lamb bears striking resemblance to another successful democratic pennsylvania senator bob casey who is also pro union and anti abortion although mr lamb takes the position that while he is personally opposed to abortion the laws should not change mr casey brand of politics and his nice guy persona work well in pennsylvania when he first ran for the senate in mr casey won the th by percentage points it all the more impressive because the man he defeated was rick santorum another angry man come to think of it who represented the district until he quit to run for the senate in another era mr casey   be called centrist now he too conservative for progressives and too liberal for conservatives the only people who like him are the voters mr lamb does not meet the test of ideological purity sought by his party progressive wing

lombardy the wealthy northern region that includes this fashionable city in landslide but pull up the league campaign manifesto dig past the strident anti immigration and anti muslim rhetoric and suddenly the tone turns more poetic italy and its thousand cultures should be the silicon valley of cultural heritage it sings one of many flourishes among the party proposals for art institutions churches and heritage sites unlike the league american cousins mr salvini is an avowed fan of president trump these italian populists like to present themselves as defenders of public cultural institutions and their make italy great again vision highlights museums as much as migration policy for mr salvini party the nationalist project goes right through the hi  of art they are not the

advertisementopinionsupported bythe politics of sex scandals by gail collinsfeb so people how do you think the sex scandal in missouri will affect the democrats attempt to take control of the senate that was actually test which part of the sentence got your attention sex or the fate of the november elections ll bet that tells lot about your character actually it easy to talk about both the     change hands if it does do you think it will involve the pennsylvania district where republican tim murphy strong anti abortion conservative had to resign after he got caught urging his lover to have an abortion if she got pregnant or the district next door where the former lover has announced she running against democratic incumbent everything tea leaf simmering in sex this week linda belcher democrat won   election for the kentucky state   of representatives in rural district that had previously been controlled by republican this was seen in some circles as sign that the democrats were going to ride an anti trump wave in november and retake control of congress the results here show that if we can win in this district we can win anywhere said the chairman of the kentucky democratic party well there were couple of details belcher had actually represented the district before then lost in to dan johnson right wing republican whose facebook posts included one depicting the obamas as apes and another announcing allah sucks mohammed sucks islam sucks johnson who was also the bishop of an evangelical church killed himself in december after he was accused of sexually assaulting year old parishioner belcher defeated his widow who is refusing to concede claiming widespread voter fraud this does feel kind of unique to be bellwether the missouri   has the advantage of being way less depressing the sex   to have been totally consensual until the point when the governor tied his naked lover to piece of exercise equipment and took her picture see you re already getting interested and haven gotten anywhere near the connection to the november senate races gov eric greitens republican is year old up and comer who was rumored to nurture presidential aspirations until the recent unpleasantness in his campaign announcement he introduced himself as navy seal native missourian and most importantly proud husband and father imagemissouri governor eric greitens in january   from an extramarital affair has led to his indictment on felony charge creditjeff roberson associated pressnow he admits that when he was gearing up to run for office in he had an affair with his hair stylist we are pretty jaded country at this point and this news alone   hardly be the sort of thing that   cause his constituents to faint or even probably mention over coffee as usual the problem came with the details greitens according to the   everyone in missouri who is not in coma now knows invited the woman to his home for series of assignations presumably when the wife and kids were off premises at one point he took her into the exercise room for sex taped her hands to some rings blindfolded her and then snapped her picture he said you re never going to mention my name the woman recounted later otherwise she said the governor warned there will be pictures of me everywhere this was during confession to her husband who secretly taped the whole thing really think it possible to feel sorry for the hair stylist this week grand jury indicted greitens for taking the picture in manner that allowed access to that image via computer which turns out to be felony greitens wife sheena is standing by him the governor is going around talking about his tax plan which does not seem to be the first thing on most people minds the republican dominated legislature is gearing up for inquiries possibly with an eye to impeachment this   leaves those of us who do not live in missouri with several questions one of which of course is what kind of person is this another is whether the scandal will have any effect on the upcoming missouri senate race in which senator claire mccaskill is one of the most vulnerable of all the democrats running for re election her opponent attorney general josh hawley has strong connections with greitens and something of hi  of attempting to be holier than thou on matters relating to sex hawley has criticized mccaskill for not being faster to call for senator al franken to resign but he still hasn demanded that his governor step down just this week he attempted to link mccaskill with harvey weinstein claiming that she gave weinstein taxpayer funded advertisement for his movie this   have been meeting mccaskill had in with philomena lee woman whose attempts to find the baby she given up for adoption in her youth had been made into weinstein film

chile leaves office in march latin america will have no female presidents there was time in when the region had four laura chinchilla in costa rica cristina fern ndez de kirchner in argentina dilma rousseff in brazil and ms bachelet now latin america is left with few prospects for female presidents in the near future more than most regions latin america has used affirmative action laws to close the gender gap in political leadership but to hold these gains and to help ensure that women   to rise to top political positions latin america needs to understand the limits of legal remedies for pulling women up quota laws for female legislative candidates have created opportunities for women to advance in politics but they have not fully transformed traditional attitudes about who should lead country women entered national congresses in significant numbers thanks to gender quotas argentina passed the world first quota law for female candidates for congress in requiring political parties to nominate women for at least percent of the open positions it was recently updated so that half of parties congressional slates must be women   all but two latin american countries have quota or parity law for legislative candidates women hold more than percent of legislative seats in costa rica ecuador mexico and nicaragua bolivia has majority female legislature in the united states by comparison women make up just percent of the   of representatives and percent of the senate many of these quota laws do more than increase the number of female candidates many require political parties to place women in favorable ballot positions and to allocate portions of their budget to training female leaders but while affirmative action laws help women get ahead they do not save them from political crises ms bachelet mrs kirchner ms rousseff and ms chinchilla led popular incumbent parties when they were elected president in region already accustomed to female leaders the three presidents on the left ms bachelet mrs kirchner and ms rousseff also benefited from the pink tide wave of leftist leadership that swept latin america from to in this period the region was buoyed by commodities boom flush with resources countries expanded social protections for workers the poor indigenous peoples people and women then the party ended economies declined and security concerns increased citizens became disillusioned and the traditional parties and their coalitions broke apart voters decided to throw most incumbents out men and women alike but the women fell harder than the men making clear that there is still double standard for male and female leaders ms chinchilla presidency was widely seen as failure even though the economy grew percent to percent during her term ms bachelet favorability nose dived following allegations that her son and daughter in law profited illicitly from real estate while president elect sebasti pi era apparently suffered no ill effects from allegations that he faked invoices to illegally finance campaign in congress impeached ms rousseff and removed her from her office for accounting practices that were long held as normal in brazil and with no evidence of her personal enrichment upon taking over from ms rousseff president michel temer chose only white men for his new cabinet in country where nonwhites are the majority mr temer recently faced accusations of corruption more serious than those against ms rousseff including allegations that he ordered his subordinates to pay hush money he survived his impeachment vote neither the left nor the right in latin america   to want female candidates these days the left favored to win after ms chinchilla departure in costa rica passed over the longtime political leader epsy campbell barr prominent politician of african descent ms campbell barr lost her bid for the party nomination for president despite having approval ratings higher than those of her male competitors and on the right the mexican politician and former first lady margarita zavala had strong poll numbers but no path to winning the nomination she recently started an independent campaign for the presidency in video criticizing the party for closing ranks against her these are not isolated events my research shows that political parties from the left and right nominate fewer women when voters think the economy is doing poorly political parties on both sides also nominate fewer women when there is increased competition in latin america disillusionment has fueled the growth of new parties more choices for voters means fewer seats for each party and parties with fewer seats to win appear less likely to take chances on women more women in office also does not mean less discrimination or harassment the glass ceiling remains while latin america outpaces the global average for women in senior management roles women hold only percent of board seats in six of latin america largest economies within legislatures women rarely lead their parties delegations and they remain absent from the most prestigious committees in colombia study found that nearly quarter of female elected officials felt silenced and were denied resources by their parties and percent of female mayors reported sexist treatment some  resistance to female politicians takes violent forms parties have long undermined quotas by asking women to resign once elected juana quispe councilwoman in bolivia was beaten to death for refusing to do so gender and parity laws matter and they have too much public support for politicians to roll them back even conservative chile now has gender quota for the legislature which almost doubled the number of women in congress in the election where the right made huge comeback but ending the sexism and hostility that drives women from power requires changing cultural attitudes and ending impunity toward violence against women costa rica has tackled traditional notions about who should lead by applying quotas to the civil society sector by law nonprofit organizations must have gender parity in their top leadership positions this includes charitable humanitarian and social

real thing it is her opponent with his back room dealing and corporate coddling and dynastic affiliations who stands as the role player and the phony many have found mr cuomo sincerity as progressive democrat dubious if not entirely unconvincing but the problem for ms nixon is that as performer of related ideologies in recent years he has done quite well ever since zephyr teachout an unknown law professor challenged him for his second term run in to surprising results in the primary he has been forced to tack left signing legislation two years ago to enact an hour minimum wage as well as paid

sitting in parliament in canberra monday feb joyce quit as party leader and deputy prime minister over sexual harassment allegation creditrod mcguirk associated pressmelbourne australia australian politics these days feels like   in people magazine political journalism indeed parliament itself has been reduced to forum for rumors about sex it all began in february with the sensational news that barnaby joyce then deputy prime minister had been having an affair with an aide who is now pregnant eventually mr joyce resigned from his leadership post and retreated to the backbench but the government response to the scandal ensured it   linger on having initially insisted that mr joyce predicament was private matter prime minister malcolm turnbull swiftly changed his view and introduced formal ban on sex between ministers and their staff this might seem like straightforward acknowledgment of the power imbalances within government official office but in truth it has meant that what might have been footnote in australian political hi  has instead set off the degradation of the country political culture consensual sexual relationship between minister and staff member has become firing offense like corruption or conflict of interest every rumor of intra office sex is now fair game for inquiry from the press and parliament sex is now officially matter of public interest this   only have deleterious effect on politics and sure enough that what has happened days after mr joyce resignation michaelia cash the minister for jobs and innovation from the conservative liberal party was being interrogated in hearing unrelated to the joyce scandal or intra office sex when she declared that bill shorten leader of the opposition labor party has been the subject of rumors for years concerning presumably sexual relationships with his female staff members this outburst   only have occurred in the context of the joyce matter the home affairs minister peter dutton made this explicit when he defended ms cash in radio interview we ve sat here taking morals lecture from bill shorten in relation to barnaby joyce over the last few weeks and people know that there hi  of problems in bill shorten personal life he said and to be lectured by the labor party really sticks in the craw but the truth is that the morals lecture came from mr turnbull labor response throughout mr joyce travails has been studiously amoral focused on questions of whether his relationship had led him to abuse public funds or whether the prime minister approved the transfer of mr joyce former employee to other ministerial offices only when the prime minister made the affair itself civil wrong by changing the office code of conduct for ministers did he make ms cash comments politically meaningful smear the real problem here is not that ms cash and mr joyce exercised poor judgment politicians have been doing that for centuries it that within this new political culture mr joyce   expect punishment for consensual affair and that ms cash was saying something squarely relevant every political journalist now has duty to explore sexual rumors and politicians have duty to investigate them in just the past few days we ve seen the national party of australia decide to quiz prospective candidates about their sex lives including visits to brothels or swingers clubs and any relationships that   compromise them if they became public mr turnbull attempt to deal with the power imbalances inherent between ministers and their staff was probably well intentioned and concern about sex and power in ministers offices is utterly reasonable but we can regulate office sexual conduct in way that doesn transform sexual behavior into matter of public interest any rules will be impossible to police except through the most corrosive and intrusive means and that is before we even consider that to impose ban like this is to dismiss the agency of the staff members and it ignores the many perfectly sound relationships to come from such unbalanced circumstances already one independent member of parliament is proposing that the ban on office sex cover all politicians not just ministers but why stop there there is often power imbalance between people of different ages should we start regulating relationships characterized by an age gap or relationships characterized by class disparity it is unlikely that mr turnbull will ever reverse the sex ban he has taken too strong moral stand on it and the ban has enough public support to make revisiting it risky political move even

entirely of african americans population she argued the current governor andrew cuomo has disregarded with too little investment in public schools too little effort made at eradicating inequality too much capitulation to big moneyed interests and venal and corrupt state legislators ms nixon laid out her biography the child of single mother with whom she had lived in fifth floor walk up graduate of new york city public schools who sends her own children to them young woman who paid for her college education herself the unspoken assertion was both obvious and deft that while she may be an actress she is in fact the real thing it is her opponent with his back room dealing and corporate coddling and dynastic affiliations who stands as the role player and the phony many have found mr cuomo sincerity as progressive democrat dubious if not entirely unconvincing but the problem for ms nixon is that as performer of related ideologies in recent years he has done quite well ever since zephyr teachout an unknown law professor challenged him for his second term run in to surprising results in the primary he has been forced to tack left signing legislation two years ago to enact an hour

christine quinn openly gay and an ally of the governor declared via the new york post that ms nixon was an unqualified lesbian who should not have opposed her own more viable bid to become the mayor of new york several years ago when mr de blasio won his first term ms quinn lost in part because she was unable to come up with pitch that voters found as resonant as mr de blasio tale of two cities

test the boundaries of an upbringing more tightly constricted than she can even begin to imagine her venture into local dance class ends with her father condemning the group painfully modest performance outfits as whorish encouraged by an older brother who started studying covertly and eventually left for college westover attempts to do likewise   deep into her father books on the th

advertisementopinionsupported byop ed contributorlatin america female leadership voidby jennifer piscopofeb leer en espa olimagecreditsarah mazzettisantiago chile after president michelle bachelet of chile leaves office in march latin america will have no female presidents there was time in when the region had four laura chinchilla in costa rica cristina fern ndez de kirchner in argentina dilma rousseff in brazil and ms bachelet now latin america is left with few prospects for female presidents in the near future more than most regions latin america has used affirmative action laws to close the gender gap in political leadership but to hold these gains and to help ensure that women   to rise to top political positions latin america needs to understand the limits of legal remedies for pulling women up quota laws for female legislative candidates have created opportunities for women to advance in politics but they have not fully transformed traditional attitudes about who should lead country women entered national congresses in significant numbers thanks to gender quotas argentina passed the world first quota law for female candidates for congress in requiring political parties to nominate women for at least percent of the open positions it was recently updated so that half of parties congressional slates must be women   all but two latin american countries have quota or parity law for legislative candidates women hold more than percent of legislative seats in costa rica ecuador mexico and nicaragua bolivia has majority female legislature in the united states by comparison women make up just percent of the   of representatives and percent of the senate many of these quota laws do more than increase the number of female candidates many require political parties to place women in favorable ballot positions and to allocate portions of their budget to training female leaders but while affirmative action laws help women get ahead they do not save them from political crises ms bachelet mrs kirchner ms rousseff and ms chinchilla led popular incumbent parties when they were elected president in region already accustomed to female leaders the three presidents on the left ms bachelet mrs kirchner and ms rousseff also benefited from the pink tide wave of leftist leadership that swept latin america from to in this period the region was buoyed by commodities boom flush with resources countries expanded social protections for workers the poor indigenous peoples people and women then the party ended economies declined and security concerns increased citizens became disillusioned and the traditional parties and their coalitions broke apart voters decided to throw most incumbents out men and women alike but the women fell harder than the men making clear that there is still double standard for male and female leaders ms chinchilla presidency was widely seen as failure even though the economy grew percent to percent during her term ms bachelet favorability nose dived following allegations that her son and daughter in law profited illicitly from real estate while president elect sebasti pi era apparently suffered no ill effects from allegations that he faked invoices to illegally finance campaign in congress impeached ms rousseff and removed her from her office for accounting practices that were long held as normal in brazil and with no evidence of her personal enrichment upon taking over from ms rousseff president michel temer chose only white men for his new cabinet in country where nonwhites are the majority mr temer recently faced accusations of corruption more serious than those against ms rousseff including allegations that he ordered his subordinates to pay hush money he survived his impeachment vote neither the left nor the right in latin america   to want female candidates these days the left favored to win after ms chinchilla departure in costa rica passed over the longtime political leader epsy campbell barr prominent politician of african descent ms campbell barr lost her bid for the party nomination for president despite having approval ratings higher than those of her male competitors and on the right the mexican politician and former first lady margarita zavala had strong poll numbers but no path to winning the nomination she recently started an independent campaign for the presidency in video criticizing the party for closing ranks against her these are not isolated events my research shows that political parties from the left and right nominate fewer women when voters think the economy is doing poorly political parties on both sides also nominate fewer women when there is increased competition in latin america disillusionment has fueled the growth of new parties more choices for voters means fewer seats for each party and parties with fewer seats to win appear less likely to take chances on women more women in office also does not mean less discrimination or harassment the glass ceiling remains while latin america outpaces the global average for women in senior management roles women hold only percent of board seats in six of latin america largest economies within legislatures women rarely lead their parties delegations and they remain absent from the most prestigious committees in colombia study found that nearly quarter of female elected officials felt silenced and were denied resources by their parties and percent of female mayors reported sexist treatment some  resistance to female politicians takes violent forms parties have long undermined quotas by asking women to resign once elected juana quispe councilwoman in bolivia was beaten to death for refusing to do so gender and parity laws matter and they have too much public support for politicians to roll them back even conservative chile now has gender quota for the legislature which almost doubled the number of women in congress in the election where the right made huge comeback but ending the sexism and hostility that drives women from power requires changing cultural attitudes and ending impunity toward violence against women costa rica has tackled traditional notions about who should lead by applying quotas to the civil society sector by law nonprofit organizations must have gender parity in their top leadership positions this includes charitable humanitarian and social service organizations bringing men into positions from which they ve historically been absent after all if more women take power in politics and business men will need something else to do jennifer

late singer juan gabriel emblazoned across the chest while others negotiated with visitors over the price of homemade poncho featuring the logo of the dallas cowboys the images of daylong excursions

revolutionary ju rez highlight the importance of the city during the war there is also an emphasis on how the americans were responsible for some of the mayhem such is the case with the exhibition dedicated to gen john pershing who led his so called punitive expedition in pursuit of villa after the mexican rebel leader led his forces into columbus and although the writers john reed and ambrose bierce are perhaps the most widely known americans who were fascinated enough by the war in mexico to become part of it the instead dedicates space to local  graphers and writers like melville jean

ciudad ju rez offers up more for visitors willing to take cab uber or drive themselves into the city villa del mar or los arcos are just two of the restaurants here that offer affordable seafood

advertisementsupported bycritic notebooka new italy imagined by artists and demagoguesby jason faragomarch milan in the prelude to the italian elections this month the far right league party did not distinguish itself for rhetorical subtlety its leader matteo salvini called islam incompatible with our values rights and freedoms he characterized the single european currency as crime against humanity and the senior league politician attilio fontana after deploring that the white race   be wiped out in italy went on to win the presidency of lombardy the wealthy northern region that includes this fashionable city in landslide but pull up the league campaign manifesto dig past the strident anti immigration and anti muslim rhetoric and suddenly the tone turns more poetic italy and

rousseff in brazil and ms bachelet now latin america is left with few prospects for female presidents in the near future more than most regions latin america has used affirmative action laws to close the gender gap in political leadership but to hold these gains and to help ensure that women   to rise to top political positions latin america needs to understand the limits of legal remedies for pulling women up quota laws for female legislative candidates have created opportunities for women to advance in politics but they have not fully transformed traditional attitudes about who should lead country women entered national congresses in significant numbers thanks to gender quotas argentina passed the world first quota law for female candidates for congress in requiring political parties to nominate women for at least percent of the open positions it was recently updated so that half of parties congressional slates must be women   all but two latin american countries have quota or parity law for legislative candidates women hold more than percent of legislative seats in costa rica ecuador mexico and nicaragua bolivia has majority female legislature in the united states by comparison women make up just percent of the   of representatives and percent of the senate many of these quota laws do more than increase the number of female candidates many require political parties to place women in favorable ballot positions and to allocate portions of their budget to training female leaders but while affirmative action laws help women get ahead they do not save them from political crises ms bachelet mrs kirchner ms rousseff and ms chinchilla led popular incumbent parties when they were elected president in region already accustomed to female leaders the three presidents on the left ms bachelet mrs kirchner and ms rousseff also benefited from the pink tide wave of leftist leadership that swept latin america from to in this period the region was buoyed by commodities boom flush with resources countries expanded social protections for workers the poor indigenous peoples people and women then the party ended economies declined and security concerns increased citizens became disillusioned and the traditional parties and their coalitions broke apart voters decided to throw most incumbents out men and women alike but the women fell harder than the men making clear that there is still double standard for male and female leaders ms chinchilla presidency was widely seen as failure even though the economy grew percent to percent during her term ms bachelet favorability nose dived following allegations that her son and daughter in law profited illicitly from real estate while president elect sebasti pi era apparently suffered no ill effects from allegations that he faked invoices to illegally finance campaign in congress impeached ms rousseff and removed her from her office for accounting practices that were long held as normal in brazil and with no evidence of her personal enrichment upon taking over from ms rousseff president michel temer chose only white men for his new cabinet in country where nonwhites are the majority mr temer recently faced accusations of corruption more serious than those against ms rousseff including allegations that he ordered his subordinates to pay hush money he survived his impeachment vote neither

campbell barr prominent politician of african descent ms campbell barr lost her bid for the party nomination for president despite having approval ratings higher than those of her male competitors and on the right the mexican politician and former first lady margarita zavala had strong poll numbers but no path to winning the nomination she recently started an independent campaign for the presidency in video criticizing the party for closing ranks against her these are not isolated events my research shows that political parties from the left and right nominate fewer women when voters think the economy is doing poorly political parties on both sides also nominate fewer women when there is increased competition in latin america disillusionment has fueled the growth of new parties more choices for voters means fewer seats for each party and parties with fewer seats to win appear less likely to take chances on women more women in office also does not mean less discrimination or harassment the glass ceiling remains while latin america outpaces the global average for women in senior management roles women hold only percent of board seats in six of latin america largest economies within legislatures women rarely lead their parties delegations and they remain absent from the most prestigious committees in colombia study found that nearly quarter of female elected officials felt silenced and were denied resources by their parties and percent of female mayors reported sexist treatment some  resistance to female politicians takes violent forms parties have long undermined quotas by asking women to resign once elected juana quispe councilwoman in bolivia was beaten to death for refusing to do so gender and parity laws matter and they have too much public support for politicians to roll them back even conservative chile now has gender quota for the legislature which almost doubled the number of women in congress in the election where the right made huge comeback

sitting in parliament in canberra monday feb joyce quit as party leader and deputy prime minister over sexual harassment allegation creditrod mcguirk associated pressmelbourne australia australian politics these days feels like   in people magazine political journalism indeed parliament itself has been reduced to forum for rumors about sex it all began in february with the sensational news that barnaby joyce then deputy prime minister had been having an affair with an aide who is now pregnant eventually mr joyce resigned from his leadership post and retreated to the backbench but the government response to the scandal ensured it   linger on having initially insisted that mr joyce predicament was private matter prime minister malcolm turnbull swiftly changed his view and introduced formal ban on sex between ministers and their staff this might seem like straightforward acknowledgment of the power imbalances within government official office but in truth it has meant that what might have been footnote in australian political hi  has instead set off the degradation of the country political culture consensual sexual relationship between minister and staff member has become firing offense like corruption or conflict of interest every rumor of intra office sex is now fair game for inquiry from the press and parliament sex is now officially matter of public interest this   only have deleterious effect on politics and sure enough that what has happened days after mr joyce resignation michaelia cash the minister for jobs and innovation from the conservative liberal party was being interrogated in hearing unrelated to the joyce scandal or intra office sex when she declared that bill shorten leader of the opposition labor party has been the subject of rumors for years concerning presumably sexual relationships with his female staff members this outburst   only have occurred in the context of the joyce matter the home affairs minister peter dutton made this explicit when he defended ms cash in radio interview we ve sat here taking morals lecture from bill shorten in relation to barnaby joyce over the last few weeks and people know that there hi  of problems in bill shorten personal life he said and to be lectured by the labor party really sticks in the craw but the truth is that the morals lecture came from mr turnbull labor response throughout mr joyce travails has been studiously amoral focused on questions of whether his relationship had led him to abuse public funds or whether the prime minister approved the transfer of mr joyce former employee to other ministerial offices only when the prime minister made the affair itself civil wrong by changing the office code of conduct for ministers did he make ms cash comments politically meaningful smear the real problem here is not that ms cash and mr joyce exercised poor judgment politicians have been doing that for centuries it that within this new political culture mr joyce   expect punishment for consensual affair and that ms cash was saying something squarely relevant every political journalist now has duty to explore sexual rumors and politicians have duty to investigate them in just the past few days we ve seen the national party of australia decide to quiz prospective candidates about their sex lives including visits to brothels or swingers clubs and any relationships that   compromise them if they became public mr turnbull attempt to deal with the power imbalances inherent between ministers and their staff was probably well intentioned and concern about sex and power in ministers offices is utterly reasonable but we can regulate office sexual conduct in way that doesn transform sexual behavior into matter of public interest any rules will be impossible to police except through the most corrosive and intrusive means and that is before we even consider that to impose ban like this is to dismiss the agency of the staff members and it ignores the many perfectly sound relationships to come from such unbalanced circumstances already one independent member of parliament is proposing that the ban on office sex cover all politicians not just ministers but why stop there there is often power imbalance between people of different ages should we start regulating relationships characterized by an age gap or relationships characterized by class disparity it is unlikely that mr turnbull will ever reverse the sex ban he has taken too strong moral stand on it and the ban has enough public support to make revisiting it risky political move even the labor party which had criticized the policy wound up pledging to keep it if it takes control of the government that is shame policy that makes office sex legitimate focus of journalistic and even

on tuesday creditandrew harrer bloombergwhen the democratic candidate conor lamb began his race in   election in pennsylvania th congressional district he faced headwinds of the type that caused horizontal snow in the nor easter last week for starters donald trump had won the district by points in the district has been held by republicans for most of the last years conservative super pacs were willing to spend millions it ended up being around million to buy tv time to savage mr lamb the incumbent tim murphy conservative anti abortion republican had lock on re election until the pittsburgh post gazette reported last year that he had urged his mistress to have an abortion republican   leaders decided that mr murphy had to go he resigned in october the man republicans chose as their candidate was rick saccone jurassic era conservative who boasted that he was trump before trump was trump that apparently was few trumps too many for voters in the th which begins in the pittsburgh suburbs and slithers its way in classic gerrymandering fashion through conservative small towns and rural areas toward the west virginia border it no wonder that mr saccone entered the race as the favorite this race was mr saccone to lose and darned if he didn absentee ballots still must be counted but mr lamb held lead of just under votes enough for him to declare victory early wednesday the news media was more cautious but if the absentee ballots match the split of the vote at the polls mr lamb narrow lead will shrink but hold the problem with political campaigns is that they don exist in theory but in fact factors like the candidate personality can carry weight as does the effectiveness of his field effort and advertising and lest we forget his position on the issues imagea supporter held up lamb cutout at an election night rally in canonsburg pennsylvania creditdrew angerer getty imagesmr saccone was wet blanket of candidate without scintilla of charisma he also didn particularly care for campaigning organized few public rallies and rarely took to the streets to speak with voters he let the super pacs do the talking for him with saturation tv ads while mr saccone was mediocre campaigner mr lamb was an excellent one he has sterling all american sum marine federal prosecutor scion of politically prominent democratic family from mount lebanon at he had the stamina and the desire to knock on door after door he stopped wearing suit and tie on block visits after one resident yelled you re jehovah witness at him mr lamb yelled right back catholic the race in the th morphed into side door referendum on mr trump and on tuesday turnout was high in both red and blue portions of the district mr lamb strongest showing was in allegheny county where suburban voters including republicans provided him with votes mr saccone ran up his votes in the three outlying counties ted kopas democrat who is westmoreland county commissioner warned about finding national or even cosmic trends in analyzing mr lamb victory before you get try to put too much theory into voters minds think all the credit should go to conor lamb mr kopas said there is no substitute for candidate who is willing to go everywhere and do anything he is the kind of person who when people meet him they like him smart and articulate he is the picture of what people want to see in congressman voters also liked his politics last weekend cecil roberts president of the united mine workers reached deep into his bag of compound adjectives to declare at lamb rally he god

progressives of abortion of politicians from the east read philadelphia of anti gun do gooders the list   go on with the demise of coal and steel and ancillary industries we are witnessing the revenge of the working class according to someone who should know david levdansky was state legislator from allegheny county pro union democrat who served for years until he was unseated by mr saccone in by votes two years later in rematch mr saccone won again by votes the defeat still stings what the collapse of core industries did was create cadre of voters who as mr levdansky said mimicking these angry voters message we want change give us change we want to punish the elected officials in office to mr levdansky mr saccone is charlatan who  izes in feeding voters red meat issues while supporting cuts in education and human services in the pennsylvania   mr saccone introduced one bill to require schools to emblazon in god we trust on every building and another to allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons without permit hillary clinton did not stand chance in the th she was running against mr anger himself president trump stopped by the district for rally on saturday night at which he spent five minutes urging the crowd to support mr saccone and minutes talking about himself if mr saccone prided himself on being trump clone mr lamb bears striking resemblance to another successful democratic pennsylvania senator bob casey who is also pro union and anti abortion although mr lamb takes the position that while he is personally opposed to abortion the laws should not change mr casey brand of politics and his nice guy persona work well in pennsylvania when he first ran for the senate in mr casey won the th by percentage points it all the more impressive because the man he defeated was rick santorum another angry man come to think of it who represented the district until he quit to run for the senate in another era mr casey   be called centrist now he too conservative for progressives and too liberal for conservatives the only people who like him are the voters mr lamb does not meet the test of ideological purity sought by his party progressive wing but the future of the party may rest upon democrats like him who have the insight to understand mr trump appeal and act accordingly ivory soap democrats won cut it in territory like the th one additional note whoever wins should take only short term lease on his district offices after all this storm and fury not to mention the millions spent the th in its current form is likely to disappear the state supreme court has redrawn all congressional district lines effective in the november election though republicans have sued in federal court to overturn the redistricting in any case if mr lamb lead holds to keep his seat he will have to run again in the fall for full two year term and although the image is still little blurry the results of the latest political rorschach test are in

that was actually test which part of the sentence got your attention sex or the fate of the november elections ll bet that tells lot about your character actually it easy to talk about both the     change hands if it does do you think it will involve the pennsylvania district where republican tim murphy strong anti abortion conservative had to resign after he got caught urging his lover to have an abortion if she got pregnant or the district next door where the former lover has announced she running against democratic incumbent everything tea leaf simmering in sex this week linda belcher democrat won   election for the kentucky state   of representatives in rural district that had previously been controlled by republican this was seen in some circles as sign that the democrats were going to ride an anti trump wave in november and retake control of congress the results here show that if we can win in this district we can win anywhere said the chairman of the kentucky democratic party well there were couple of details belcher had actually represented the district before then lost in to dan johnson right wing republican whose facebook posts included one depicting the obamas as apes and another announcing allah sucks mohammed sucks islam sucks johnson who was also the bishop of an evangelical church killed himself in december after he was accused of sexually assaulting year old parishioner belcher defeated his widow who is refusing to concede claiming widespread voter fraud this does feel kind of unique to be bellwether the missouri   has the advantage of being way less depressing the sex   to have been totally consensual until the point when the governor tied his naked lover to piece of exercise equipment and took her picture see you re already getting interested

we are pretty jaded country at this point and this news alone   hardly be the sort of thing that   cause his constituents to faint or even probably mention over coffee as usual the problem came with the details greitens according to the   everyone in missouri who is not in coma now knows invited the woman to his home for series of assignations presumably when the wife and kids were off premises at one point he took her into the exercise room for sex taped her hands to some rings blindfolded her and then snapped her picture he said you re never going to mention my name the woman recounted later otherwise she said the governor warned there will be pictures of me everywhere this was during confession to her husband who secretly taped the whole thing really think it possible to feel sorry for the hair stylist this week grand jury indicted greitens for taking the picture in manner that allowed access to that image via computer which turns out to be felony greitens wife sheena is standing by him the governor is going around talking about his tax plan which does not seem to be the first thing on most people minds the republican dominated legislature is gearing up for inquiries possibly with an eye to impeachment this   leaves those of us who do not live in missouri with several questions one of which of course is what kind of person is this another is whether the scandal will have any effect on the upcoming missouri senate race in which senator claire mccaskill is one of the most vulnerable of all the democrats running for re election her opponent attorney general josh hawley has strong connections with greitens and something of hi  of attempting to be holier than thou on matters relating to sex hawley has criticized mccaskill for not being faster to call for

advertisementopinionsupported byop ed contributorlatin america female leadership voidby jennifer piscopofeb leer en espa olimagecreditsarah mazzettisantiago chile after president michelle bachelet of chile leaves office in march latin america will have no female presidents there was time in when the region had four laura chinchilla in costa rica cristina fern ndez de kirchner in argentina dilma rousseff in brazil and ms bachelet now latin america is left with few prospects for female presidents in the near future more than most regions latin america has used affirmative action laws to close the gender gap in political leadership but to hold these gains and to help ensure that women   to rise to top political positions latin america needs to understand the limits of legal remedies for pulling women up quota laws for female legislative candidates have created opportunities for women to advance in politics but they have not fully transformed traditional attitudes about who should lead country women entered national congresses in significant numbers thanks to gender quotas argentina passed the world first quota law for female candidates for congress in requiring political parties to nominate women for at least percent of the open positions it was recently updated so that half of parties congressional slates must be women   all but two latin american countries have quota or parity law for legislative candidates women hold more than percent of legislative seats in costa rica ecuador mexico and nicaragua bolivia has majority female legislature in the united states by comparison women make up just percent of the   of representatives and percent of the senate many of these quota laws do more than increase the number of female candidates many require political parties to place women in favorable ballot positions and to allocate portions of their budget to training female leaders but while affirmative action laws help women get ahead they do not save them from political crises ms bachelet mrs kirchner ms rousseff and ms chinchilla led popular incumbent parties when they were elected president in region already accustomed to female leaders the three presidents on the left ms bachelet mrs kirchner and ms rousseff also benefited from the pink tide wave of leftist leadership that swept latin america from to in this period the region was buoyed by commodities boom flush with resources countries expanded social protections for workers the poor indigenous peoples people and women then the party ended economies declined and security concerns increased citizens became disillusioned and the traditional parties and their coalitions broke apart voters decided to throw most incumbents out men and women alike but the women fell harder than the men making clear that there is still double standard for male and female leaders ms chinchilla presidency was widely seen as failure even though the economy grew percent to percent during her term ms bachelet favorability nose dived following allegations that her son and daughter in law profited illicitly from real estate while president elect sebasti pi era apparently suffered no ill effects from allegations that he faked invoices to illegally finance campaign in congress impeached ms rousseff and removed her from her office for accounting practices that were long held as normal in brazil and with no evidence of her personal enrichment upon taking over from ms rousseff president michel temer chose only white men for his new cabinet in country where nonwhites are the majority mr temer recently faced accusations of corruption more serious than those against ms rousseff including allegations that he ordered his subordinates to pay hush money he survived his impeachment vote neither the left nor the right in latin america   to want female candidates these days the left favored to win after ms chinchilla departure in costa rica passed over the longtime political leader epsy campbell barr prominent politician of african descent ms campbell barr lost her bid for the party nomination for president despite having approval ratings higher than those of her male competitors and on the right the mexican politician and former first lady margarita zavala had strong poll numbers but no path to winning the nomination she recently started an independent campaign for the presidency in video criticizing the party for closing ranks against her these are not isolated events my research shows that political parties from the left and right nominate fewer women when voters think the economy is doing poorly political parties on both sides also nominate fewer women when there is increased competition in latin america disillusionment has fueled the growth of new parties more choices for voters means fewer seats for each party and parties with fewer seats to win appear less likely to take chances on women more women in office also does not mean less discrimination or harassment the glass ceiling remains while latin america outpaces the global average for women in senior management roles women hold only percent of board seats in six of latin america largest economies within legislatures women rarely lead their parties delegations and they remain absent from the most prestigious committees in colombia study found that nearly quarter of female elected officials felt silenced and were denied resources by their parties and percent of female mayors reported sexist treatment some  resistance to female politicians takes violent forms parties have long undermined quotas by asking women to resign once elected juana quispe councilwoman in bolivia was beaten to death for refusing to do so gender and parity laws matter and they have too much public support for politicians to roll them back even conservative chile now has gender quota for the legislature which almost doubled the number of women in congress in the election where the right made huge comeback but ending the sexism and hostility that drives women from power requires changing cultural attitudes and ending impunity toward violence against women costa rica has tackled traditional notions about who should lead by applying quotas to the civil society sector by law nonprofit organizations must have gender parity in their top leadership positions this includes charitable humanitarian and social service organizations bringing men into positions from which they ve historically been absent after all if more women take power in politics and business men will need something else to do jennifer
