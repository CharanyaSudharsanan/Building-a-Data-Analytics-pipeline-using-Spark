harris pp little brown imagewhen will someone stick up for millennials we have been sheltered by our parents swindled by our universities deadened by our therapists and for all this our reward has been glib condescension from the boomer press rising to our defense is harris our peer born as the book cover notes familiar provocateur from the internet left flank harris contends that america has stiffed our generation filling childhoods with homework and extracurricular activities all of this ostensibly served to prepare us for college and fruitful careers when really all it resulted in was the almost inevitable heartbreak of falling short of our parents expectations and ours harris spins recognizable   of hostile job market characterized by declines in worker solidarity and wages he uses the concept of human capital to analyze how much time millennials have invested in themselves by way of schoolwork and for what every authority from moms to presidents told millennials to accumulate as much human capital as we   and we did but the market hasn held up its end of the bargain he brings fresh contrarian eye to some of the usual data points he sees in the obama era nationalization of student debt not an aid to youngsters but goofy scheme to stimulate consumer demand for rising tuition costs at america public universities he blames greedy administrators rather than benighted state legislatures he argues that millennials deserved loot has been hoarded by the ownership class and seniors who have saved entitlement programs that serve them as steady government jobs disappear and the social safety net withers he also broadens his survey to cover school discipline and youtube stars and he makes surprising case that sexting isn as harmful as it cracked up to be as generational advocates go we   do worse than harris but he ends his book with fatalism nearly as flippant as the generational critiques he loathes despite this moment of political fellowship among millennials he writes off the possibility of meaningful change coming from government or social movements once we take over not optimistic myself no but what is our generation if not rich in skills we may yet put to good use the selfie generation how our self images are changing our notions of privacy sex consent and culture by alicia eler pp skyhorse imagethe social internet has been gripped in recent weeks by an app google arts and culture which relies on total trust from its users or perhaps their total lack of concern for privacy the app encourages users to take and upload selfies so that google facial recognition algorithm might compare them to its vast digital art archive google says it does not store the selfies one year ago our generation was donating to the now we re taking  s of ourselves for multinational corporation that has cooperated with the government surveillance programs such is the allure of the selfie eler who is the visual arts critic for the star tribune in minnesota and also millennial has published for years on the selfie and its implications for privacy self expression and sex in the selfie she finds an aspirational image essential to being seen by others online she sees the selfie as lifeline to those who struggle to be represented in the media ecosystem she mentions transpeople and agoraphobes and not all selfie takers she proves are as oblivious as imagined unfortunately eler book   have benefited from more careful edit her discursive style is some  whimsical but mostly distracting she dwells on topic having little to do with selfies and then glosses over complicated selfie related stories fake news in the election gets at least seven pages the macaque who took selfie and then saw peta sue for his copyright gets just two she provides an extended discussion of blogs that post screenshots of bad tinder conversations but glosses over the july facebook live stream by diamond reynolds after her husband philando castile was shot by the police and while there are moments where her light touch suits the material well section on social media surveillance at standing rock is hindered by her choice to discuss it through quoting meeting she had over coffee with protester in spite of its flaws though eler book alights on the source of the selfie power it is the easiest way to assert one humanity in our hyper networked world perhaps our much fussed over narcissism is not flaw but survival tactic igen why   super connected kids are growing up less rebellious more tolerant less happy and completely unprepared for adulthood by jean twenge pp atria imageback in the psychologist twenge swiped at millennials in her book generation me she wrote then that we were miserable entitled narcissists ruined by our parents adoration she was trying to rebut neil howe and the late william strauss the gurus of generational theory who had contended in that civic oriented millennials   become the next great generation time has evidently softened her her new igen pities rather than disdains those born after arguing that smartphone addiction has saddled new generation with profound psychological problems including sleep deprivation depression and unshakable senses of loneliness and fear they drink less and have less sex they socialize less without their parents present they hardly read for pleasure or go to the mall they eschew church and even spirituality they kill themselves more but others less they wait longer to get drivers licenses and give birth twenge premises her conclusions on longitudinal studies of high schoolers and college students which she supplements with first person accounts from members of igen she concludes by offering this advice do not sleep with it or give it nude pictures of yourself it is not your lover do not continuously turn your attention to it when you are talking with someone in person it is not your best friend twenge is right to highlight smartphones contributions to our malaise in one section she notes the feeling of rejection that arises from text sent without an immediate response and in another she notes that more screen time leads to less in person socializing which breeds loneliness she   stand to incorporate some of harris alarm about the economy she duly recognizes income inequality as prime source of igen anxiety about its future but while she discusses how smartphones do their harm she has no such harsh words for the modern labor market instead she tells marketers how to exploit igen diminished expectations which struck me as

horizontal snow in the nor easter last week for starters donald trump had won the district by points in the district has been held by republicans for most of the last years conservative super pacs were willing to spend millions it ended up being around million to buy tv time to savage mr lamb the incumbent tim murphy conservative anti abortion republican had lock on re election until the pittsburgh post gazette reported last year that he had urged his mistress to have an abortion republican   leaders decided that mr murphy had to go he resigned in october the man republicans chose as their candidate was rick saccone jurassic era conservative who boasted that he was trump before trump was trump that apparently was few trumps too many for voters in the th which begins in the pittsburgh suburbs and slithers its way in classic gerrymandering fashion through conservative small towns and rural areas toward the west virginia border it no wonder that mr saccone entered the race as the favorite this race was mr saccone to lose and darned if he didn absentee ballots still must be counted but mr lamb held lead of just under votes enough for him to declare victory early wednesday the news media was more cautious but if the absentee ballots match the split of the vote at the polls mr lamb narrow lead will shrink but hold the problem with political campaigns is that they don exist in theory but in fact factors like the candidate personality can carry weight as does the effectiveness of his field effort and advertising and lest we forget his position on the issues imagea supporter held up lamb cutout at an election night rally in canonsburg pennsylvania creditdrew angerer getty imagesmr saccone was wet blanket of candidate without scintilla of charisma he also didn particularly care for campaigning organized few public rallies and rarely took to the streets to speak with voters he let the super pacs do the talking for him with saturation tv ads while mr saccone was mediocre campaigner mr lamb was an excellent one he has sterling all american sum marine federal prosecutor scion of politically prominent democratic family from mount lebanon at he had

suburban voters including republicans provided him with votes mr saccone ran up his votes in the three outlying counties ted kopas democrat who is westmoreland county commissioner warned about finding national or even cosmic trends in analyzing mr lamb victory before you get try to put too much theory into voters minds think all the credit should go to conor lamb mr kopas said there is no

successful democratic pennsylvania senator bob casey who is also pro union and anti abortion although mr lamb takes the position that while he is personally opposed to abortion the laws should not change mr casey brand of politics and his nice guy persona work well in pennsylvania when he first ran for the senate in mr casey won the th by percentage points it all the more impressive because the man he defeated was rick santorum another angry man come to think of it who represented the district until he quit to run for the senate in another era mr casey   be called centrist now he too conservative for progressives and too liberal for conservatives the only people who like him are the voters mr lamb does not meet the test of ideological purity sought by his party progressive wing
