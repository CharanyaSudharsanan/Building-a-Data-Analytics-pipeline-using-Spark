chile leaves office in march latin america will have no female presidents there was time in when the region had four laura chinchilla in costa rica cristina fern ndez de kirchner in argentina dilma rousseff in brazil and ms bachelet now latin america is left with few prospects for female presidents in the near future more than most regions latin america has used affirmative action laws to close the gender gap in political leadership but to hold these gains and to help ensure that women   to rise to top political positions latin america needs to understand the limits of legal remedies for pulling women up quota laws for female legislative candidates have created opportunities for women to advance in politics but they have not fully transformed traditional attitudes about who should lead country women entered national congresses in significant numbers thanks to gender quotas argentina passed the world first quota law for female candidates for congress in requiring political parties to nominate women for at least percent of the open positions it was recently updated so that half of parties congressional slates must be women   all but two latin american countries have quota or parity law for legislative candidates women hold more than percent of legislative seats in costa rica ecuador mexico and nicaragua bolivia has majority female legislature in the united states by comparison women make up just percent of the   of representatives and percent of the senate many of these quota laws do more than increase the number of female candidates many require political parties to place women in favorable ballot positions and to allocate portions of their budget to training female leaders but while affirmative action laws help women get ahead they do not save them from political crises ms bachelet mrs kirchner ms rousseff and ms chinchilla led popular incumbent parties when they were elected president in region already accustomed to female leaders the three presidents on the left ms bachelet mrs kirchner and ms rousseff also benefited from the pink tide wave of leftist leadership that swept latin america from to in this period the region was buoyed by commodities boom flush with resources countries expanded social protections for workers the poor indigenous peoples people and women then the party ended economies declined and security concerns increased citizens became disillusioned and the traditional parties and their coalitions broke apart voters decided to throw most incumbents out men and women alike but the women fell harder than the men making clear that there is still double standard for male and female leaders ms chinchilla presidency was widely seen as failure even though the economy grew percent to percent during her term ms bachelet favorability nose dived following allegations that her son and daughter in law profited illicitly from real estate while president elect sebasti pi era apparently suffered no ill effects from allegations that he faked invoices to illegally finance campaign in congress impeached ms rousseff and removed her from her office for accounting practices that were long held as normal in brazil and with no evidence of her personal enrichment upon taking over from ms rousseff president michel temer chose only white men for his new cabinet in country where nonwhites are the majority mr temer recently faced accusations of corruption more serious than those against ms rousseff including allegations that he ordered his subordinates to pay hush money he survived his impeachment vote neither the left nor the right in latin america   to want female candidates these days the left favored to win after ms chinchilla departure in costa rica passed over the longtime political leader epsy campbell barr prominent politician of african descent ms campbell barr lost her bid for the party nomination for president despite having approval ratings higher than those of her male competitors and on the right the mexican politician and former first lady margarita zavala had strong poll numbers but no path to winning the nomination she recently started an independent campaign for the presidency in video criticizing the party for closing ranks against her these are not isolated events my research shows that political parties from the left and right nominate fewer women when voters think the economy is doing poorly political parties on both sides also nominate fewer women when there is increased competition in latin america disillusionment has fueled the growth of new parties more choices for voters means fewer seats for each party and parties with fewer seats to win appear less likely to take chances on women more women in office also does not mean less discrimination or harassment the glass ceiling remains while latin america outpaces the global average for women in senior management roles women hold only percent of board seats in six of latin america largest economies within legislatures women rarely lead their parties delegations and they remain absent from the most prestigious committees in colombia study found that nearly quarter of female elected officials felt silenced and were denied resources by their parties and percent of female mayors reported sexist treatment some  resistance to female politicians takes violent forms parties have long undermined quotas by asking women to resign once elected juana quispe councilwoman in bolivia was beaten to death for refusing to do so gender and parity laws matter and they have too much public support for politicians to roll them back even conservative chile now has gender quota for the legislature which almost doubled the number of women in congress in the election where the right made huge comeback but ending the sexism and hostility that drives women from power requires changing cultural attitudes and ending impunity toward violence against women costa rica has tackled traditional notions about who should lead by applying quotas to the civil society sector by law nonprofit organizations must have gender parity in their top leadership positions this includes charitable humanitarian and social service organizations bringing men into positions from which they ve historically been absent after all if more women take power in politics and business men will need something else to do jennifer
