that was actually test which part of the sentence got your attention sex or the fate of the november elections ll bet that tells lot about your character actually it easy to talk about both the     change hands if it does do you think it will involve the pennsylvania district where republican tim murphy strong anti abortion conservative had to resign after he got caught urging his lover to have an abortion if she got pregnant or the district next door where the former lover has announced she running against democratic incumbent everything tea leaf simmering in sex this week linda belcher democrat won   election for the kentucky state   of representatives in rural district that had previously been controlled by republican this was seen in some circles as sign that the democrats were going to ride an anti trump wave in november and retake control of congress the results here show that if we can win in this district we can win anywhere said the chairman of the kentucky democratic party well there were couple of details belcher had actually represented the district before then lost in to dan johnson right wing republican whose facebook posts included one depicting the obamas as apes and another announcing allah sucks mohammed sucks islam sucks johnson who was also the bishop of an evangelical church killed himself in december after he was accused of sexually assaulting year old parishioner belcher defeated his widow who is refusing to concede claiming widespread voter fraud this does feel kind of unique to be bellwether the missouri   has the advantage of being way less depressing the sex   to have been totally consensual until the point when the governor tied his naked lover to piece of exercise equipment and took her picture see you re already getting interested and haven gotten anywhere near the connection to the november senate races gov eric greitens republican is year old up and comer who was rumored to nurture presidential aspirations until the recent unpleasantness in his campaign announcement he introduced himself as navy seal native missourian and most importantly proud husband and father imagemissouri governor eric greitens in january   from an extramarital affair has led to his indictment on felony charge creditjeff roberson associated pressnow he admits that when he was gearing up to run for office in he had an affair with his hair stylist we are pretty jaded country at this point and this news alone   hardly be the sort of thing that   cause his constituents to faint or even probably mention over coffee as usual the problem came with the details greitens according to the   everyone in missouri who is not in coma now knows invited the woman to his home for series of assignations presumably when the wife and kids were off premises at one point he took her into the exercise room for sex taped her hands to some rings blindfolded her and then snapped her picture he said you re never going to mention my name the woman recounted later otherwise she said the governor warned there will be pictures of me everywhere this was during confession to her husband who secretly taped the whole thing really think it possible to feel sorry for the hair stylist this week grand jury indicted greitens for taking the picture in manner that allowed access to that image via computer which turns out to be felony greitens wife sheena is standing by him the governor is going around talking about his tax plan which does not seem to be the first thing on most people minds the republican dominated legislature is gearing up for inquiries possibly with an eye to impeachment this   leaves those of us who do not live in missouri with several questions one of which of course is what kind of person is this another is whether the scandal will have any effect on the upcoming missouri senate race in which senator claire mccaskill is one of the most vulnerable of all the democrats running for re election her opponent attorney general josh hawley has strong connections with greitens and something of hi  of attempting to be holier than thou on matters relating to sex hawley has criticized mccaskill for not being faster to call for senator al franken to resign but he still hasn demanded that his governor step down just this week he attempted to link mccaskill with harvey weinstein claiming that she gave weinstein taxpayer funded advertisement for his movie this   have been meeting mccaskill had in with philomena lee woman whose attempts to find the baby she given up for adoption in her youth had been made into weinstein film so far we have  s of naked woman taped to exercise rings sex scandal on the republican side and meeting to talk about adoption issues for the democrat can wait to see what happens next maybe another
