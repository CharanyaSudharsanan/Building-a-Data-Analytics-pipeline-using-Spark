on tuesday creditandrew harrer bloombergwhen the democratic candidate conor lamb began his race in   election in pennsylvania th congressional district he faced headwinds of the type that caused horizontal snow in the nor easter last week for starters donald trump had won the district by points in the district has been held by republicans for most of the last years conservative super pacs were willing to spend millions it ended up being around million to buy tv time to savage mr lamb the incumbent tim murphy conservative anti abortion republican had lock on re election until the pittsburgh post gazette reported last year that he had urged his mistress to have an abortion republican   leaders decided that mr murphy had to go he resigned in october the man republicans chose as their candidate was rick saccone jurassic era conservative who boasted that he was trump before trump was trump that apparently was few trumps too many for voters in the th which begins in the pittsburgh suburbs and slithers its way in classic gerrymandering fashion through conservative small towns and rural areas toward the west virginia border it no wonder that mr saccone entered the race as the favorite this race was mr saccone to lose and darned if he didn absentee ballots still must be counted but mr lamb held lead of just under votes enough for him to declare victory early wednesday the news media was more cautious but if the absentee ballots match the split of the vote at the polls mr lamb narrow lead will shrink but hold the problem with political campaigns is that they don exist in theory but in fact factors like the candidate personality can carry weight as does the effectiveness of his field effort and advertising and lest we forget his position on the issues imagea supporter held up lamb cutout at an election night rally in canonsburg pennsylvania creditdrew angerer getty imagesmr saccone was wet blanket of candidate without scintilla of charisma he also didn particularly care for campaigning organized few public rallies and rarely took to the streets to speak with voters he let the super pacs do the talking for him with saturation tv ads while mr saccone was mediocre campaigner mr lamb was an excellent one he has sterling all american sum marine federal prosecutor scion of politically prominent democratic family from mount lebanon at he had the stamina and the desire to knock on door after door he stopped wearing suit and tie on block visits after one resident yelled you re jehovah witness at him mr lamb yelled right back catholic the race in the th morphed into side door referendum on mr trump and on tuesday turnout was high in both red and blue portions of the district mr lamb strongest showing was in allegheny county where suburban voters including republicans provided him with votes mr saccone ran up his votes in the three outlying counties ted kopas democrat who is westmoreland county commissioner warned about finding national or even cosmic trends in analyzing mr lamb victory before you get try to put too much theory into voters minds think all the credit should go to conor lamb mr kopas said there is no substitute for candidate who is willing to go everywhere and do anything he is the kind of person who when people meet him they like him smart and articulate he is the picture of what people want to see in congressman voters also liked his politics last weekend cecil roberts president of the united mine workers reached deep into his bag of compound adjectives to declare at lamb rally he god fearing union supporting gun owning job protecting pension defending democrat the th has long been the anger zone of state politics populated by contrarians known mostly for their dislikes of social progressives of abortion of politicians from the east read philadelphia of anti gun do gooders the list   go on with the demise of coal and steel and ancillary industries we are witnessing the revenge of the working class according to someone who should know david levdansky was state legislator from allegheny county pro union democrat who served for years until he was unseated by mr saccone in by votes two years later in rematch mr saccone won again by votes the defeat still stings what the collapse of core industries did was create cadre of voters who as mr levdansky said mimicking these angry voters message we want change give us change we want to punish the elected officials in office to mr levdansky mr saccone is charlatan who  izes in feeding voters red meat issues while supporting cuts in education and human services in the pennsylvania   mr saccone introduced one bill to require schools to emblazon in god we trust on every building and another to allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons without permit hillary clinton did not stand chance in the th she was running against mr anger himself president trump stopped by the district for rally on saturday night at which he spent five minutes urging the crowd to support mr saccone and minutes talking about himself if mr saccone prided himself on being trump clone mr lamb bears striking resemblance to another successful democratic pennsylvania senator bob casey who is also pro union and anti abortion although mr lamb takes the position that while he is personally opposed to abortion the laws should not change mr casey brand of politics and his nice guy persona work well in pennsylvania when he first ran for the senate in mr casey won the th by percentage points it all the more impressive because the man he defeated was rick santorum another angry man come to think of it who represented the district until he quit to run for the senate in another era mr casey   be called centrist now he too conservative for progressives and too liberal for conservatives the only people who like him are the voters mr lamb does not meet the test of ideological purity sought by his party progressive wing but the future of the party may rest upon democrats like him who have the insight to understand mr trump appeal and act accordingly ivory soap democrats won cut it in territory like the th one additional note whoever wins should take only short term lease on his district offices after all this storm and fury not to mention the millions spent the th in its current form is likely to disappear the state supreme court has redrawn all congressional district lines effective in the november election though republicans have sued in federal court to overturn the redistricting in any case if mr lamb lead holds to keep his seat he will have to run again in the fall for full two year term and although the image is still little blurry the results of the latest political rorschach test are in and it doesn look good for mr trump or his party tom ferrick jr is reporter who has covered pennsylvania government and politics since the follow the   opinion section on facebook and twitter
