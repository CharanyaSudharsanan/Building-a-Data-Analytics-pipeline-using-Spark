what do we make of the curious case of ryan holiday and his captivating new book conspiracy about the riveting drama that conjoined in kind of bataan death march the unlikely trio of the silicon valley billionaire peter thiel the pro wrestling superstar hulk hogan terry bollea and the gawker founder nick denton imagepeter thielcreditandrew white for the  is holiday gifted autodidact as one   easily believe after absorbing the elegant spare prose of conspiracy and its seemingly timeless message about human nature or is he simply the master media manipulator he once proudly boasted to be in forbes is conspiracy profound masterwork by talented young writer or merely another pelt for the mantle on holiday acre ranch in bastrop county tex what clear is that holiday is an out of the box thinker who likes to take chances california native he quit the university of california riverside after his sophomore year to take year job at the collective hollywood talent agency he had turned summer internship into an offer of full time employment and was egged on by samantha hoover classmate and the woman who   become holiday wife was the kid who was going places he told the   in profile he apprenticed with the best selling author robert greene and before long american apparel the mostly defunct retail clothing chain lured holiday away to head the company public relations department in the middle of crisis its founder dov charney was accused of sexual assault holiday eventually resigned and american apparel filed for bankruptcy appalled and disillusioned holiday scored six figure advance to write an expos of the public relations game starting him on new career path of author journalist and hipster provocateur he and hoover lived together in los angeles new orleans and then new york city in they bought ranch near austin and started raising two chickens two goats biscuit and bucket and family by their brood had grown to include cattle three goats chickens ducks geese guinea hen and baby son holiday also has gauge shotgun caliber rifle bow and arrow and winchester that he keeps by his bed to ward off coyotes imageholiday is the founder of brass check marketing and advisory firm with clients like google and the authors tony robbins tim ferriss and of course greene the name brass check is an example of holiday wit it refers both to upton sinclair account of the journalism industry and to slang for when bullet is in the chamber of semiautomatic pistol and ready to be fired he is also the media columnist for the new york observer owned by family trust associated with jared kushner he is years old conspiracy is his seventh book it is important for the book readers to be aware that holiday the college dropout is also huge believer in stoicism an ancient greek and roman philosophy that preaches suffering humility acceptance and endurance without complaint he became zealot while at college after   marcus aurelius meditations four   in row and then affixing his favorite passages from the book to the walls of his dorm room holiday is nothing if not erudite every time you turn around in conspiracy he is trying to make profound points by quoting from vast range of philosophers statesmen and great thinkers everyone from machiavelli and seneca to kierkegaard and george trow and on and on but incessant name dropping aside which tends to detract from his gripping narrative holiday has written one helluva page turner he documents how starting in the secretive thiel sought to take revenge on denton for outing him on gawker just because denton   and because he figured the news   generate the clicks and the kind of attention denton and his erstwhile enterprise craved thiel rightly offended began stealth campaign to punish denton for his callous and cavalier behavior imagehulk hogancreditchris carlson associated pressat chance meeting in germany thiel enlisted the help of someone holiday refers to only as mr and then charles harder the los angeles attorney who recently represented donald trump in his wildly unsuccessful legal effort to stop the publication of michael wolff fire and fury armed with million or so from thiel mr and harder dug up everything they   find about denton his colleagues at gawker gawker itself its parent company gawker media and some of the other people gawker offended they also needed novel legal theory about what denton had done figuring that the first amendment   protect denton and gawker when in october gawker made the momentous decision to publish without permission excerpts from sex tape involving hogan and his former best friend wife thiel not only had the perfect protagonist in an equally angry and determined hogan but also legal theory based on the idea that hogan privacy had been invaded as had thiel five years earlier unbeknown to denton and his company lawyers thiel had decided to bankroll hogan in his legal battle against gawker and denton in classic david and goliath fashion denton tragically underestimated his foes and paid the iron price as has been well documented elsewhere denton lost the five count lawsuit in florida courtroom and was slapped with million verdict gawker media had no choice but to file for bankruptcy its carcass was sold to the highest bidder to his considerable credit and for reasons that aren entirely made clear holiday decided to write conspiracy after both thiel and denton approached him separately wanting to share with him their views of the blockbuster case he less successful it seems to me in pushing his view throughout the book that thiel mr hogan and harder were involved in an old fashioned conspiracy in the stoical sense of the word to bring down denton and his crew yes they triumphed wildly and beyond anything they   have expected but  n that just be chalked up to having the better and more sympathetic legal argument rather than to having better tactics strategies and morally superior way of living of course this occam razor approach to the gawker case   not lend itself as easily to public relations mastermind skills conspiracy was embargoed for reasons that aren clear either much of its contents are already publicly known and each page of the uncorrected proof was stamped with an annoyingly large confidentiality notice holiday is nothing if not new kind of clever in keeping with stoicism tenets about self effacement in holiday twitter profile   his face is completely covered by his two hands but make no mistake the genius is at work already promoting recent observer column is about
