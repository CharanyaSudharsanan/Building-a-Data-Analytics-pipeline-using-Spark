advertisementopinionsupported bytrump hacked the media right before our eyesby ross douthatmarch imagewe never stopped watching credit andrew harrer bloomberglet get one thing straight am not fan of facebook confident that social media is cancer on our private lives and source of derangement in our politics take it for granted that the tech barons are acquiring the power to tilt elections and that they ll be happy to play handmaidens to tyrants soft and hard so long as they can monetize our data take certain mordant pleasure in watching mark zuckerberg and his minions scapegoated for the political failures of late obama era liberalism but the liberal establishment fixation on facebook sins first the transmission of fake news and now the exploitation of its data by the trump campaign or its appendages still feels like classic example of blaming something new because it new when it the old thing that mattered more or of blaming something new because you thought that new meant good that the use of social media data by campaigns   always help tech savvy liberals and not their troglodytic rivals and the shock of discovering otherwise obscures the more important role that older forms of media played in making the trump era reality no doubt all the activity on facebook and the apparent use of facebook data had some impact somewhere on trump surprise victory but the media format that really made him president the one whose weaknesses and perversities and polarizing tendencies he brilliantly exploited wasn zuckerberg unreal kingdom it wasn even the twitter platform where trump struts and frets and rages daily it was that old pre internet standby broadcast and cable television and e ly tv news start with the fake news that laid the foundation for trump presidential campaign not the sort that circulates under clickbait headlines in your facebook feed but the sort broadcast in prime time by nbc under the label of reality tv yes as media sophisticates we re all supposed to know that reality means fake but in the beginning nobody marketed the apprentice that way across most of its run you saw much bankrupted real estate tycoon portrayed week after week and season after season as titan of industry the for serious greatest businessman in the world where did so many people originally get the idea that trump was the right guy to fix our manifestly broken government not from russian bots or targeted social media ad buys but from prime time show that sold itself as real and sold him as business genius forget unhappy blue collar heartlanders forget white nationalists and birthers the core trump demographic might just have been republicans who watched the apprentice who bought the fake news that his television program and its network sponsors gladly sold them that was step one in the trump hack of television media step two was the use of his celebrity to turn news channels into infomercials for his campaign yes his fame also boosted him on social media but there you can partially blame algorithms and the unwisdom of crowds with television news there were actual human beings charged with exercising news judgment and inclined to posture as civic minded actors when it suits them making the decision to hand day after day of free coverage to donald trump rallies outrages feuds and personal attacks nothing that cambridge analytica did to help the trump campaign target swing voters and there reason to think it didn do as much as it claimed had anything remotely like the impact of this alwaystrump tsunami which probably added up to more than billion in effective advertising for his campaign during the primary season flood that drowned all of his rivals pathetic tens of millions and as cynical as believe the lords of silicon valley to be the more important cynicism in belonged to those television execs who were fine with enabling the wild trumpian takeover of the because after all republicans deserved it and hillary was sure to beat him in the end except that she didn beat him in part because he also exploited the polarization that cable news in particular is designed to feed in this polarization didn just mean that fox became steadily more pro trump as he dispatched his rivals it also meant that network like cnn which thrives on team red vs team blue conflict felt compelled to turn airtime over to trump surrogates like jeffrey lord and corey lewandowski and kayleigh mcenany because their regular stable of conservative commentators was one of them simply wasn pro trump enough the depth and breadth of trump skepticism among right wing pundits was pretty solid indicator of his unfitness for high office but e ly once he won the nomination this skepticism was often filtered out of cable coverage because the important thing was to maintain the partisan shouting match model this in turn encouraged sense that this was just typical right versus left election in which you should vote for trump if you usually voted for republicans and in the end that what most voters did my own cnn experiences were positive admire the many fine journalists who work in television news but it was clear enough being in that orbit in as it should be clear to anyone who watched trump larger relationship to his television coverage that the business model of our news channels both assumes and heightens polarization and that it was ripe for exploitation by demagogue who was also celebrity it also clear as the economists levi boxell matthew gentzkow and jesse shapiro wrote in these pages late last year that among older white americans the core demographic where first the primaries and then the general election were decided television still far outstrips the internet as the most important source of news and indeed the three economists noted for all the talk about breitbart influence and russian meddling and dark web advertising trump only improved on mitt romney showing among americans who don use the internet and he actually lost support among internet using voters in sense you   argue all those tweets mattered mainly because they kept being quoted on tv which is not to say that the current freakout over facebook doesn make certain kind of sense beyond the psychological satisfaction of weaving the often genuinely sinister side of silicon valley into stolen election theories there strategic wisdom to the center left establishment focus on the internet what trump did will be hard for future demagogue to imitate the generations who get their information from newscasts are dying out the web is taking over at an accelerating pace and in the long run there is more to be gained in going after mark zuckerberg than in pillorying jeff zucker and pillorying fox hosts only helps their brand the big tech companies regard themselves as part of the liberal cultural complex so they re vulnerable to progressive bullying and shaming not so sean hannity whose stalwart support for trump was and remains vastly more important than any online stratagem in the end as michael brendan dougherty wrote recently for national review one implicit goal of the facebook freakout is to ensure that conservatives and populists will not be allowed to use the same tools as democrats and liberals again or at least not use them effectively if the trauma of trump victory turns social media gatekeepers into more aggressive and self conscious stewards of the liberal consensus the current freakout will have more than served its political purpose but like the television channels whose programming choices did far more than facebook to make donald trump president it won have served the truth invite you to follow me on twitter douthatnyt follow the
