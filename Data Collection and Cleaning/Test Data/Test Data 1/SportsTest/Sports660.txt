supported by books tell us things about your book inside the fevered minds of sports fans by john williamsfeb     the main   share this page     the main     credit patricia wall the   if you ve never had your heart broken or your nerves thoroughly frayed by sporting event you know someone who has as young journalist at the los angeles   in the george dohrmann   field late night phone calls from rabid fans he wondered being fan himself why the depth of their devotion mystified him my blindness to the root causes of their thinking and conduct was also ignorance about myself he writes in his new book superfans into the heart of obsessive sports fandom dohrmann who spent time as an investigative reporter at sports illustrated and is now senior editor at the athletic spoke to everyday fans academics and scientists about what it is that drives our vicarious competitive mania below he talks about whether kids should be fans his admiration for the soccer player clint dempsey and more when did you first get the idea to write this book it long been curiosity of mine why people were so intense about their favorite team certainly had my favorites throughout my life as young person it was notre dame football and growing up in california the giants in baseball and the warriors in basketball most of those teams fell away but what became my one true obsession was the united states men national soccer team but never on the level that   see from people both as young journalist and then later when was doing investigative journalism on colleges getting death threats from fans who were upset what is it that makes people this passionate love sports too but how did they get there then had kids have an eight year old and five year old and started asking myself about fandom and how to introduce it to them it all came together three or four years ago it felt like the moment professionally and personally for me to dive into this book there are so many books that explore someone individual fandom but those aren that accessible if not red sox fan not going to read book about red sox fan thought if you wrote something that introduced different people from around the country that was more approachable way to analyze fandom     the main   advertisement     the main   what the most surprising thing you learned while writing it   george dohrmann credit adam moore talked to susan harter renowned child psychologist about how kids receive their parents fandom she told me that we shouldn be introducing our kids to fandom until adolescence this runs contrary to what we do we put baby in green bay packers onesie this is what we see all the time and we celebrate it posting pictures of it and saying how cute it is but kid wrote about an eagles fan was just melting down in youtube videos while the patriots were beating his team harter said kids want to see the world in black and white they want to divide the world into good and bad and sports does that but the kids don understand that the fact that their teacher is an auburn fan doesn make them bad person they don understand that daddy going to be when his team loses they lack perspective they can say well it been good season even though we lost this game some  now watch game outside the home so my kids don see me yelling at the tv and see that it important to me don want them to make it important right now

fan athlete engagement in the book more opportunities for athletes to confront the fans who often say critical things about them thought that   make for good   and did reach out to some athletes but ultimately concluded that part of fandom blazing is what they call it that troll behavior while it exists it felt like falling into trap just looking at the worst of fans there is some bad behavior in the book but it felt too voyeuristic to keep highlighting these really extreme negative fans advertisement     the main   who is creative person not writer who has influenced you and your work for long time my favorite national team player was clint dempsey liked him because he was successful but loved how he was successful and why loved that he grew up poor and had to go outside the traditional soccer development system he wasn put on the conveyor belt to greatness that inspiring someone who works outside the system and still gets to the top of it he   take risks on the field it was like he was saying going to try for greatness and might look foolish some  and it might not work out but going to shoot for greatness here that was something to love and admire about him and something that anyone can bring into their own work we have to take shots here persuade someone to read superfans in words or less lot of people wonder about sports fans behavior they might be husbands wives brothers sisters roommates girlfriends boyfriends these people ask why are they like that this book will open your eyes so wide to that behavior and you ll be able to tick off the
