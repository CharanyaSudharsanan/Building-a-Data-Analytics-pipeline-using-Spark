advertisementsupported bysports of the  the me too movement inevitably spills into sportsimagethe united states won the team gold in women gymnastics at the london olympics at least one member of the team mckayla maroney has accused team doctor of sexually abusing her over period of years creditdoug mills the  by juliet macuroct there were more names of course there were in gymnastics and in so many other sports swimming and judo and hockey and basketball there are always more girls more women more names this time the brave athlete stepping forward was mckayla maroney an olympic champion who posted twitter message on wednesday morning that was shocking yet sadly not so shocking at all was molested by dr larry nassar the team doctor for the us women national gymnastics team and olympic team maroney wrote adding her name to the growing list of gymnasts who have accused nassar of abusing them and to the growing list of women deciding to share their stories people should know that this is not just happening in hollywood maroney wrote reference to the harvey weinstein revelations that have become me too phenomenon on social media this is happening everywhere have my own me too stories many women do and to be crystal clear my experiences were very different from what maroney and the other gymnasts have described which includes accusations of serious crimes doctor molesting dozens of minors during his long career but distinguishing levels of harassment or abuse or rape is not the point of any of this the point is to stop this all of this so far more than women including athletes who competed at the highest levels of gymnastics have come forward to say that nassar had touched them inappropriately during medical appointments unlike weinstein nassar is in jail awaiting trial on multiple counts of criminal sexual conduct he already has pleaded guilty to child pornography charges he denies the many accusations of sexual assault and faces decades of prison time regardless of how many charges are leveled or how many lawsuits are filed we might never know how many young gymnasts have stories similar to the one maroney told on wednesday it sickens me to consider that there are probably many many more but now we know maroney was one of them and odds are she won be the last to raise her hand to say me too maroney said her abuse at the hands of nassar began when she was on tuesday the former soviet gymnast and olympic gold medalist tatiana gutsu also said me too gutsu did so on facebook accusing not doctor but an ex olympic teammate vitaly scherbo of raping her in when she was this is me being brave after years gutsu wrote she called scherbo monster who kept me in my own prison to be afraid for so many years imagemaroney won gold medal at the summer games in london years after she said team doctor abused his position to sexually assault her creditchang lee the  if you re taken aback by this wave of raw honesty and surprised by the sheer numbers of me too posts out there then you re probably not woman to so many of us too many of us none of this is new during congressional hearing about sexual abuse in sports in march rick adams the chief of paralympic sports for the united states olympic committee sat between two gymnasts and testified that the olympic community failed the people it supposed to protect those people who remained unprotected were athletes young ones older ones ones who have had to carry the burden of abuse for years their lips zipped and their hearts heavy ones whose parents had entrusted them to coaches adults who were supposed to keep those children safe ones who attended national gymnastics team training camps at bela and martha karolyi rural texas ranch where nassar often met with the gymnasts in their rooms alone and molested them some of the athletes whispered among themselves that they felt uncomfortable with nassar so called techniques but the stories stayed secrets the gymnasts careers were on the line wherever there is position of power there seems to be potential for abuse maroney wrote had dream to go to the olympics and the things that had to endure to get there were unnecessary and disgusting the nassars and the weinsteins of the world who haven been outed yet should be worried about me too because now that women can see that they re not alone more will speak up because so many of them have stories to tell like me there was the time when covered nascar in the and was cornered by top driver in the back of his trailer while trying to conduct an interview as the cars roared around the racetrack he blocked the door and said he  n let me leave unless kissed him the team publicist saved me by knocking on the door or the time when another driver kept putting his hand on my leg as sat next to him during group interview or the meeting at the olympics where man in public relations threw himself at me hands grabbing as soon as he closed his office door forcing me to talk my way out of the room thought all of those experiences were just par for the course for woman in sports and in many ways it turns out they were but those moments were degrading and frustrating and isolating after all just wanted to do my job like anyone else and so never shared those details  n believe that ended up in those situations and was embarrassed without the boldness of so many other women as so many of them join hands to pull back the curtain on this problem still might have preferred to say nothing that silence is exactly what abusers are counting on they can count on it
