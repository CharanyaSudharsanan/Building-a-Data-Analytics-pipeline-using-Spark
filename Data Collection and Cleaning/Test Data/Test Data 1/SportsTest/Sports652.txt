the winter olympics in sochi credit mikhail klimentyev agence france presse getty images lausanne switzerland what do you think about your new president you are shocked the man posing the question to me was mikhail kusnirovich owner of russia largest department store he and donald trump had tried to strike deal to bring the miss universe pageant to red square years before he said he went on to answer his own question think he going to be good it was december in mr kusnirovich office overlooking the kremlin weeks before united states intelligence agencies   publicly conclude that russia had interfered in the election in the interest of tilting it toward mr trump nesting dolls with the american president elect face stared out of stalls at the holiday markets but the topic at hand for me was not election meddling but rather russia sophisticated cheating at the winter olympics in sochi russia two subversions of global sports and american democracy have more in common than you may think both involve intelligence agents russia will to win and the same cyberespionage team both have prompted millions of dollars of investigations and challenged public confidence in the purity of sport and in the strength of democracy the two breaches are at the heart of how president vladimir putin has suggested he wants to reclaim russia past by weakening western democracy and dominating world sports advertisement     the main   mr kusnirovich belonged to group of prominent public figures focused on restoring russian sports to good global standing the group was created last summer by mr putin after revelations that the nation had stolen medals in sochi by relying on steroid laced martinis hundreds of ounces of stockpiled clean urine and the overnight stealth of the country federal security service     the main   advertisement     the main   the kremlin dismissed the details of both schemes as absurd but on tuesday russia was barred from the winter games for its state backed cheating some individual russian athletes may compete independently in neutral uniforms but the russian flag will not appear when the games begin in pyeongchang south korea the details of the sports scandal deconstructed by russian whistle blowers who have provided rare insider insights offer perhaps the purest case study of russia drive to dominate its brazen methods and in part its motivation to influence the american presidency in declassified intelligence report released early this year united states officials said russia attacks on the election had been for mr putin partial payback for the doping scandal which he repeatedly called an american led effort to defame russia last month as new medals were stripped from russian olympians mr putin said the disqualifications were the united states attempt to undermine his re election in fact sports regulators and investigators who conducted the multiple investigations into russia doping are headquartered in canada and the olympic leadership in charge of disqualifying athletes is based in switzerland it was the former president of that staunchly neutral country samuel schmid who conducted the latest investigation for the olympic committee resulting in tuesday sanctions in scrutinizing russia sports and antidoping officials have said they acted on objective forensic and scientific evidence of russia fraud documents data lab analyses and glass bottles of urine with telltale signs of tampering just as allies of the   counsel robert mueller have done this year in the context of the election inquiry the officials have defended their impartiality and interest in plain facts three key whistle blowers helped provide those facts grigory rodchenkov russia former longtime chief antidoping chemist as well as yuliya and vitaly stepanov former russian runner and former employee of the nation antidoping agency all now live in the united states in undisclosed locations from which they have spoken openly about years of coordinated cheating the justice department too has taken interest in their evidence dr rodchenkov whose personal diaries cataloged each day of cheating in sochi came to the united states only after vitaly mutko russia deputy prime minister and former sports minister asked him to resign in light of growing global suspicions about the extent of the nation cheating which the chemist had

advertisement     the main   dr rodchenkov tell all account reported in the   in may and detailed in the documentary icarus culminated in russia olympic ban this week it was instrumental in motivating some russian officials to temper their rigid denials and acknowledge that an institutional conspiracy had existed though they maintained it had not been state sponsored still before this week final sanctions were announced global athletes antidoping advocates and some sponsors had expressed concern about growing crisis in international sports pointing to the long delay by both regulators and olympic officials in responding to evidence of widespread cheating that went even beyond sochi as those critics wondered when or if sports officials   penalize russia for its systematic transgressions by rescinding olympic medals and condemning the state supported schemes they questioned not just fundamental frailties in drug testing controls but also the independence of antidoping authorities one year later similar basic questions about separation of power have taken on renewed relevance in american politics as result of russia breaches those questions have followed mr trump repeated attacks on the independence of the justice department in defiance of the post watergate norms intended to insulate law enforcement from partisan and personal agendas in the same way that mr trump has avoided acknowledging evidence of russia interference in the election thomas bach president of the international olympic committee took more than year to accept the extensive evidence of russia interference in the sochi olympic lab operations other sports officials such as the president of skiing governing body initially told me that the evidence on russia was conspiratorial or too hollywood just as some republican lawmakers have doubted the legitimacy of mr mueller mandate in drawing out his decision making until this week mr bach called for due process and stressed the importance of giving russia fair chance to defend itself advertisement     the main   one defense came just after the early penalties for russian athletes at the olympics set of cyberattacks group known as fancy bear which american intelligence officials tied to russia main military intelligence unit the published the hacked private medical records of top american athletes as well as the private emails of antidoping officials who had lobbied for ban on russia the hackers the same group that stole emails from the democratic national committee servers and released them ahead of the election called the athlete records proof of illegal drug use by stars such as simone biles and serena williams all athletes had received necessary clearances to use the substances in question and none of the information constituted violation in fiery interview in moscow last year mr mutko the former sports minister and current deputy prime minister echoed mr putin arguing that russia had been disadvantaged globally in sports as in all things he said the decks were stacked against the nation this week he was barred from attending any future olympics though he remains at the helm of russia soccer world cup
