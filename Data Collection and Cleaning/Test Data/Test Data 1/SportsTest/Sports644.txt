general manager of the philadelphia ers in the team was middling franchise whose city like most cities felt it had won fewer titles than it deserved one route to actually winning those titles seemed clear championships are won by teams with superstar and preferably two or three the most efficient way to secure such superstars is through the annual draft and the draft rules give an advantage to the teams with the worst records as hinkie took the reins fans quickly concluded that he was preparing to attempt novel strategy the sixers   tank deliberately fielding poor teams whose bottom of the league finishes   net them high draft picks this   take while to bring positive results but hinkie implored fans to ignore the team losses and look at the big picture we talk lot about process he said not outcome within couple of years this process had become the process and the phrase trust the process had become catechism for certain brand of fan joel embiid one of the first and biggest talents hinkie plan brought to philadelphia even adopted the nickname the process fans in philadelphia have been known to chant trust the process as he steps up to take free throws over time hinkie plan started to look as if it was working quite well perhaps too well last year full season after the polarizing hinkie submitted page letter of resignation the proposed new draft procedures that   make losing less attractive sports are defined by clear rules predictable mechanics and unambiguous results you really can devise workable system around them the same goes for game like blackjack in which your chances are consistent the dealer behavior is printed right on the table and everyone agrees on what makes good outcome the odds may be against you casinos are after all business but there really is an objectively correct way to play many hands even when you lose the process remains sound real life is not at all like blackjack and yet the same faith in process crops up in even the messiest realms late last year white   spokesman dismissed fears over robert mueller investigation by suggesting that the administration should be as sanguine as one of its lawyers take deep breath follow ty cobb lead trust the process anthony scaramucci during his abbreviated reign as white   communications director argued for health care system that   trust the process of the free market like in telecom like in airlines those industries of notoriously satisfied consumers two years ago new yorker article mentioned one person who adopted trust the process mantra while taking an improv class he left his career in venture capital and got into buddhist podcast process can be soothing we defer to it almost out of habit as if it is machine that will resolve all conflicts so long as we can resist meddling with its workings but what if those workings and the conflicts behind them are precisely what we should be meddling with and arguing over the difference between process and any old series of events is that process is designed to lead to an outcome legal trial is in theory classic process two antagonists have their say under fair terms and agree to abide by the result one absurdity in kafka the trial is that the trial thing whose entire purpose is to produce an ending does not end the original german title is der process among the united states most cherished processes is the one enshrined in the fifth amendment and later the fourteenth no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the set of rights we ve come to think of as due process is process at its best offering whole litany of protections designed to minimize wrongful convictions presumption of innocence the right to an attorney the requirement that guilt be proved to an exceptionally high standard our generous conception of due process is source of national pride so much so that we some  come to expect it in every area of life for the past several months this has been the question raised as men are accused of sexual misbehavior or misconduct what kind of process might the accused be owed before suffering any consequences e ly if those consequences are as informal as having people generally despise you or demand your resignation from high profile job this is an open and debatable question and there are people in position to propose concrete answers to it and yet we ve often seen them call for process as way to avoid taking any clear position when white   adviser rob porter resigned amid reports of domestic abuse president trump tweeted is there no such thing any longer as due process but he was not to all appearances suggesting that porter be tried in court of law and if porter deserved some formal hearing before departing his job surely it was the trump administration itself that   have to provide it late last november as pressure built on representative john conyers to resign over accusations of sexual harassment the   minority leader nancy pelosi appeared on meet the press and maintained that we are strengthened by due process when asked how she might use her own powers to address the situation she   for instance have suspended him from his ranking position on the   judiciary committee she declined to give an answer invoking process lets us delegate our own judgments to some ostensibly neutral mechanism system that will formally decide things that might be difficult for us to decide ourselves but it can also absolve us of the responsibility to engage with the questions around us it can offer us cover for taking the positions we wanted to all along columbia university for instance has declined to negotiate with union formed by its graduate students even after that union was approved by the national labor relations board and voted on by the students themselves stance that will push the matter into further litigation we have declined to bargain the university provost said in january until the legal process has been allowed to run its course this is one kind of language process can speak sorry it seems to say our hands are tied we re forced to let this play out in precisely the way we already preferred in as the police beat protesters outside the democrats presidential convention in chicago the party establishment inside nominated the hawkish hubert humphrey even though majority of primary voters had supported robert kennedy or eugene mccarthy candidates who advocated quicker exit from the vietnam war it e ly disappointing to people my age college sophomore from new mexico told the   afterward the adults told us to trust the political process but process is not magical ritual it is designed to accomplish something specific and if it fails it can be redesigned of the constitutional amendments ratified since the bill of rights have changed the rules of voting and representation and after humphrey was defeated by richard nixon the democrats found themselves revisiting their primary system commission led by donald fraser and george mcgovern peacenik senator from south dakota proposed changes to the primaries that   transfer power from party bosses to the rank and file three presidential elections later after the candidates this new system encouraged including mcgovern failed to thrive democrats changed the rules again swinging authority back to party loyalists with the creation of superdelegates in those superdelegates came to seem to supporters of an insurgent bernie sanders like an emblem of the party establishment preference for the presumptive nominee hillary clinton at the party convention the democratic national committee created another commission to examine voting processes it issued its recommendations late in including measures like drastically reducing the number of superdelegates and opening caucuses to absentee participation many in the party have joined in support of these changes no less than tim kaine clinton handpicked running mate tweeted early this month we democrats need to do away with superdelegates once and for all they are given undue influence and make the presidential nominating process less democratic but even explaining those recommendations might require for some audiences the gauzy reassurance that the status quo won be upset too much one commission member jan bauer told the des moines register that iowa her home state
