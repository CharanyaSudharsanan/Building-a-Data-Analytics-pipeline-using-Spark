whom had partnered to cover women gymnastics during the rio olympics was also wondering and voiced her frustration in group message on slack we wondered what we   do with the resources of the   in the few days between statements and sentencing to amplify the voices of these women it was easily the largest number of accusers in sexual abuse case in sports hi  what   we do in the short time we had to communicate the staggering scale the deputy editor on our digital news design desk team whose task is to find opportunities to use visuals to tell compelling   wanted to let the women represent themselves through both  s and their own words wanted to represent the anger and the power that come with facing your abuser in court which is what saw on every face as searched through  s from the hearing the   editor beth flynn kept editors on top of this for the next couple of days to help search through images and get permission for  s from other organizations also called on the graphics

burst into tears at my desk the reason visual  telling is so compelling is because it creates an intense connection between you and the subject it also the reason creating these pieces can wear on you carla concurred much of what heard during the hearing was not new to me but it still kept me awake at night she said understood the scope of the problem long before now but seeing and hearing the women speak simultaneously broke my heart and inspired me gymnastics requires particular combination of dedication strength and grace so it fitting to me that it was group of gymnasts and other athletes who finally exposed this unprecedented scale of abuse and who stood their ground in court made their stories public and proved the power of women standing together to amplify one another
