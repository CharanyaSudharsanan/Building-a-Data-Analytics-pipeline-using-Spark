profitable macaroni company leading indirectly to decision by congress that college sports if not college owned noodle business should be exempt from taxation   as the hugely lucrative football bowl season wraps up colleges fear that the new tax law signed by president trump   derail their gravy train two provisions target coaches high salaries and booster donations tied to ticket purchases but they need not worry much there are no plans to start taxing television revenue and corporate sponsorships two of the biggest income streams which together transformed intercollegiate athletics into multibillion dollar business even with the legislative changes collegiate sports remain largely tax exempt the beneficiary of public subsidy that is increasingly difficult to defend the corrosive culture of money in big time college sports more than billion year among the national collegiate athletic association division sports programs was painfully obvious recently with the indictments of college coaches and an adidas executive charged with paying bribes to recruit basketball players and steer them to agents it was left to federal prosecutors to issue statement condemning the criminal influence of money on coaches and student athletes the tax exempt nature of college sports is not the cause of these problems rather it is rocket fuel for an engine that has escaped the gravitational pull of common sense and decency to understand how this is possible consider the balance sheet of the atlantic coast conference home of the national champions in football clemson and men basketball north carolina its corporate sponsors include toyota gatorade and geico when the conference filed its annual tax return for it reported about quarter billion dollars from broadcasting games for its member universities as well as million in other sports related revenue its commissioner earned million the was huge commercial success with income that   normally generate huge tax bill but no taxes were owed as the conference explained in its filing with the internal revenue service the atlantic coast and its member schools are nonprofit charitable organizations that place an emphasis on academic excellence the atlantic coast conference it said seeks to maximize the educational and athletic opportunities of its student athletes while enriching their quality of life the magic word here is educational student athletes have always been considered unpaid amateurs engaging in extracurricular activities rather than profitable professions so college sports is deemed part of the educational mission of schools and exempt from income taxes there are specific and contentious interpretations of law that prop up this assumption in the modern era but they have weakened as big time college sports has taken on the trappings of profit driven business far removed from the cloistered groves of academe it is only through decades of aggressive lobbying and legal battles that universities have managed to avoid income taxes on billions of dollars from broadcast rights sponsorships and donations from boosters the seminal moment came in response to an attempt by to extend its tax exempt status to profits generated by mueller company pasta maker that had been donated to its law school in congress took notice and eventually enacted the unrelated business income tax to capture revenue considered ancillary to nonprofit organization mission sensing the threat the pressed lawmakers to make sure that the new tax   not apply to money from school sports programs accordingly congressional committee reports declared that athletic activities of schools are substantially related to their educational functions even citing the supposed educational benefits of football and basketball so an escape hatch was opened for college sports over the years the has periodically tried to close it in the late the agency looked at the relatively new stream of television revenue from college games and considered treating it as taxable unrelated business income this ignited spirited lobbying campaign by colleges and the until the retreated declaring that selling tickets to fans who go to the school stadium was not all that different from broadcasting games to television audience clearly the did not foresee the commercialized power  that college sports   become driven by national television viewership for example in the big east conference first year of operation in it earned for the right to broadcast all of its games three decades later espn   offer more than million for those rights other attempts to tax college sports profits have been mostly rejected by lawmakers in the congress did an end run around the and decreed that corporate sponsorships did not amount to advertising which   be subject to the unrelated business income tax it was not until the recently approved republican tax plan that lawmakers reversed course eliminating partial deduction for booster donations tied to the sale of game tickets and imposing an excise tax on college employee salaries exceeding million over all however most athletics revenue  s to flow tax free that means the college sports machine keeps cranking out expensive entertainment and the scandals that go with it while sheltered by the scholastic equivalent of cayman islands tax dodge if president trump wants to repatriate and tax corporate profits stashed offshore he might also consider the untaxed billions hiding in plain sight on campuses right here at home mike mcintire an investigative
