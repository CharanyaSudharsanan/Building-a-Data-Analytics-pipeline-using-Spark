thursday creditsaeed khan agence france presse getty imageswe all have our reasons for watching sports but at the forefront of mine is watching incredible athletes do incredible things they do things we cannot and it is magical want to see them thrive do not want to see them struggle for air thursday afternoon in melbourne at the australian open the french tennis player ga monfils in the middle of tense match against novak djokovic one of the greatest players of all time begged for help the surface temperature on the court registered at degrees celsius or degrees fahrenheit sick to the stomach monfils told the judges monfils one of the most athletic and fit players on the tour at the year first major wasn just hot he was scared tired and dizzy he went on he thought he had small heat stroke for minutes he staggered off the court between sets gasping going to collapse the response of the chair umpire in charge of the event was not here is some water or let take break or even good news ga this place has roof let close it it was instead reminder that players are allowed only second break between points so get back out there afterward djokovic who won the match but looked as haggard and sickly as monfils did said there is limit and that is level of guess tolerance between being fit and being think in danger in terms of health   was right at the limit when you watch two world class professionals barely able to lift their rackets in one of their sport signature events you can help but wonder what exactly we re trying to prove here reason we watch sports is to see the planet most talented dedicated athletes perform at the highest levels to see true physical genius in their chosen pursuits it is not to watch them perform at fraction of their abilities because they can hardly stand there has long been fetishization of athletes being able to withstand the elements to overcome them en route to victory the marathoner who survives degree temperatures the football player who braves frigid weather to win the big game but why to appreciate true genius is to see it uninhibited by exterior circumstances to see it in its purest natural element sports are entertainment and part of that entertainment is to see athletic genius at work why   we want to see wonderful athlete unable to be his or her best because it absurdly hot or cold outside the beauty is in the performance not what surrounds it   you appreciate say daniel day lewis performance more because it was done in storage freezer or in the middle of blazing desert never mind that knowing him he probably still win an oscar isn the art itself enough the has constructed whole cottage industry out of frozen tundra as spectacle all born from the infamous ice bowl of the championship game in which the packers outlasted the cowboys at lambeau field in conditions where the wind chill reached about minus degrees fahrenheit but that game is compelling only as lore in the moment it was virtually unwatchable and barely even resembled football during the game the packers quarterback bart starr got frostbite in his fingers the linebacker ray nitschke frostbite was so awful his toenails fell off the marching band in attendance  n play because the woodwinds froze after whistling for kickoff the referee norm schachter realized that his whistle was stuck to his lips when he tried to remove it the skin ripped from his mouth the refs stopped using their whistles after that and communicated by screaming for play to stop fan in the stands died this was not football this was simply bunch of men trying not to freeze to death and yet the game is still talked about as classic decades later to the detriment not just of the men and women who play but of the pleasure of the fans who watch them weather does not enhance the enjoyment of sports it stands in the way we watch sports to see great quarterback throw perfect pass to win the big game we do not watch the ball hit stiff wind and flutter like wounded duck   anyone want to watch basketball game where jump shots   be blown off course what   that tell us about who was the better team to watch the monfils djokovic match was to watch two men wilting and withering away neither looked like even close to the star tennis players we ve seen them both be for years closing the roof and providing climate controlled environment to play every sport in optimal conditions for athletes to thrive  n just be more humane to the players it   be far more enjoyable to watch we want to see athletes do incredible things that we cannot we do not want to see them begging for break so that they do not collapse sports aren endurance tests they re entertainment what best for the athlete is helpfully also what best for us will leitch is senior writer for sports on
