harris pp little brown imagewhen will someone stick up for millennials we have been sheltered by our parents swindled by our universities deadened by our therapists and for all this our reward has been glib condescension from the boomer press rising to our defense is harris our peer born as the book cover notes familiar provocateur from the internet left flank harris contends that america has stiffed our generation filling childhoods with homework and extracurricular activities all of this ostensibly served to prepare us for college and fruitful careers when really all it resulted in was the almost inevitable heartbreak of falling short of our parents expectations and ours harris spins recognizable   of hostile job market characterized by declines in worker solidarity and wages he uses the concept of human capital to analyze how much time millennials have invested in themselves by way of schoolwork and for what every authority from moms to presidents told millennials to accumulate as much human capital as we   and we did but the market hasn held up its end of the bargain he brings fresh contrarian eye to some of the usual data points he sees in the obama era nationalization of student debt not an aid to youngsters but goofy scheme to stimulate consumer demand for rising tuition costs at america public universities he blames greedy administrators rather than benighted state legislatures he argues that millennials deserved loot has been hoarded by the ownership class and seniors who have saved entitlement programs that serve them as steady government jobs disappear and the social safety net withers he also broadens his survey to cover school discipline and youtube stars and he makes surprising case that sexting isn as harmful as it cracked up to be as generational advocates go we   do worse than harris but he ends his book with fatalism nearly as flippant as the generational critiques he loathes despite this moment of political fellowship among millennials he writes off the possibility of meaningful change coming from government or social movements once we take over not optimistic myself no but what is our generation if not rich in skills we may yet put to good use the selfie generation how our self images are changing our notions of privacy sex consent and culture by alicia eler pp skyhorse imagethe social internet has been gripped in recent weeks by an app google arts and culture which relies on total trust from its users or perhaps their total lack of concern for privacy the app encourages users to take and upload selfies so that google facial recognition algorithm might compare them to its vast digital art archive google says it does not store the selfies one year ago our generation was donating to the now we re taking  s of ourselves for multinational corporation that has cooperated with the government surveillance programs such is the allure of the selfie eler who is the visual arts critic for the star tribune in minnesota and also millennial has published for years on the selfie and its implications for privacy self expression and sex in the selfie she finds an aspirational image essential to being seen by others online she sees the selfie as lifeline to those who struggle to be represented in the media ecosystem she mentions transpeople and agoraphobes and not all selfie takers she proves are as oblivious as imagined unfortunately eler book   have benefited from more careful edit her discursive style is some  whimsical but mostly distracting she dwells on topic having little to do with selfies and then glosses over complicated selfie related stories fake news in the election gets at least seven pages the macaque who took selfie and then saw peta sue for his copyright gets just two she provides an extended discussion of blogs that post screenshots of bad tinder conversations but glosses over the july facebook live stream by diamond reynolds after her husband philando castile was shot by the police and while there are moments where her light touch suits the material well section on social media surveillance at standing rock is hindered by her choice to discuss it through quoting meeting she had over coffee with protester in spite of its flaws though eler book alights on the source of the selfie power it is the easiest way to assert one humanity in our hyper networked world perhaps our much fussed over narcissism is not flaw but survival tactic igen why   super connected kids are growing up less rebellious more tolerant less happy and completely unprepared for adulthood by jean twenge pp atria imageback in the psychologist twenge swiped at millennials in her book generation me she wrote then that we were miserable entitled narcissists ruined by our parents adoration she was trying to rebut neil howe and the late william strauss the gurus of generational theory who had contended in that civic oriented millennials   become the next great generation time has evidently softened her her new igen pities rather than disdains those born after arguing that smartphone addiction has saddled new generation with profound psychological problems including sleep deprivation depression and unshakable senses of loneliness and fear they drink less and have less sex they socialize less without their parents present they hardly read for pleasure or go to the mall they eschew church and even spirituality they kill themselves more but others less they wait longer to get drivers licenses and give birth twenge premises her conclusions on longitudinal studies of high schoolers and college students which she supplements with first person accounts from members of igen she concludes by offering this advice do not sleep with it or give it nude pictures of yourself it is not your lover do not continuously turn your attention to it when you are talking with someone in person it is not your best friend twenge is right to highlight smartphones contributions to our malaise in one section she notes the feeling of rejection that arises from text sent without an immediate response and in another she notes that more screen time leads to less in person socializing which breeds loneliness she   stand to incorporate some of harris alarm about the economy she duly recognizes income inequality as prime source of igen anxiety about its future but while she discusses how smartphones do their harm she has no such harsh words for the modern labor market instead she tells marketers how to exploit igen diminished expectations which struck me as tacky and not particularly useful besides the kids may spend too much time on their phones but they know better than to trust brands jack dickey year old millennial is staff writer for sports
