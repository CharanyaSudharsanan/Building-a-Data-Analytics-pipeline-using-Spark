east river as long and as tall as cruise ship the sleek glass structure loomed above rusty century old dry docks serving notice to the industrial neighborhood that the new economy was coming the project known as dock is the brainchild of wework the fast growing new york start up valued at whopping billion in just eight years wework has built network of shared working spaces around the globe but wework chief executive and co founder adam neumann isn content to just lease out communal offices mr neumann lanky longhaired year old israeli wants nothing less than to radically transform the way we work live and play when dock is completed this year if the aggressive timeline holds it will represent the fullest expression of mr neumann expansive vision to date there will be an enormous co working space luxury spa and large offices for other companies like ibm and verizon that are designed and run by wework there will be juice bar real bar gym with boxing studio an outdoor basketball court and panoramic vistas of manhattan there will be restaurants and maybe even dry cleaning services and barbershop it will be the kind of place you never have to leave until you need to go to sleep and if mr neumann has his way you ll sleep at one of the apartments he is renting nearby it an all encompassing sort of ambition and mr neumann is the brash and idealistic pitchman simply by encouraging strangers to share beer at the office he argues wework can heal our fractured society how do you change the world mr neumann asked in recent interview bring people together where is the easiest big place to bring people together in the work environment imagethe newest wework building now under construction at the brooklyn navy yard when the   building is completed it will represent the fullest expression of the company expansive vision to date creditcole wilson for the  it may sound simplistic but around the globe companies are buying whatever it is that mr neumann and his co founder miguel mckelvey are selling wework has rapidly expanded to countries assembled formidable executive team and attracted some members big companies like jpmorgan chase and siemens are signing on as tenants and revenues are growing fast expected to top billion this year wework last year bought the iconic lord taylor building on fifth avenue in manhattan which is being transformed into the company new headquarters that deal was made possible in part by recent billion investment from softbank the japanese technology group led by the enigmatic billionaire masayoshi son already the company has started welive its residential offering and rise its gym it acquired meetup the social network that facilitates in person gatherings and the flatiron school coding academy still to come wegrow the company for profit elementary school set to open in september wework has even invested in plans to create giant wave pools for inland surfing company ostensibly about co working now employs yoga instructors architects teachers environmental scientists software engineers molecular biologists and social psychologists is it all bit much for young company still trying to build out its core business ve made that argument said bruce dunlevie wework board member and partner at the venture capital firm benchmark but he said great entrepreneurs like adam don listen to guys like me as wework expands in all directions it faces persistent questions about its rich valuation and the durability of its business model critics argue that the company does little more than corporate real estate arbitrage leasing space spiffing it up then subleasing it out to other tenants the company owns hardly any properties giving it precious few hard assets its growth projections strike many as unattainable and it has missed expectations before number of upstarts loom as potential competitors seeking to replicate wework success and many wework tenants are unproven start ups that   quickly fold iwg publicly traded co working company that has more members and more real estate than wework is valued at just billion yet mr neumann has convinced investors that wework is worth   that figure adam explanation for the valuation of wework speaks for itself said chris kelly co founder and president of convene company that offers flexible event spaces and is backed by major real estate firms this is not an excel spreadsheet calculation he believes there an energy behind the brand and he gotten people to invest at that valuation he has not tried to explain it in traditional financial terms indeed to assess wework by conventional metrics is to miss the point according to mr neumann wework isn really real estate company it state of consciousness he argues generation of interconnected emotionally intelligent entrepreneurs and mr neumann with his combination of inspiration and chutzpah wants to transform not just the way we work and live but the very world we live in image how do you change the world says adam neumann one of the founders of wework bring people together where is the easiest big place to bring people together in the work environment creditpeter prato for the  it an audacious perhaps delusional plan for company that made its mark by building communal desks and providing refreshments and so far it seems to be working mr son wework largest investor is betting that the company will grow exponentially in the years to come making his multibillion dollar investment veritable bargain make it   bigger than your original plan mr son told forbes late last year if you think in that manner the valuation is cheap it can be worth few hundred billion dollars close communitiesthe notion that white collar workers might actually like their offices is relatively new one from the counting s of industrial england to the skyscrapers of manhattan offices were mostly uninspiring places designed to maximize space often with row upon row of unglamorous desks the only kind of model that anyone had for laying out large workplace was factory said nikil saval author of cubed secret hi  of the workplace so the office was made to resemble an assembly line this dreary state of affairs began to change in earnest at least for some during the dot com bubble tech companies built playful offices with beanbags and ping pong tables making work spaces less formal free food became commonplace raised expectations for amenities and interior design gradually seeped into the mainstream and   more and more employees e ly millennials expect enlightened unconventional offices enter wework with people bouncing between employers jobs concentrated in cities and technology making it easier to work remotely the demand for co working was suddenly real and ready to be monetized mr neumann who grew up on kibbutz in israel had an epiphany bring the communal vibe to the office soon he and friend mr mckelvey an equally tall oregonian who grew up on collective and was working as an architect founded an eco friendly co working space in brooklyn they sold it but they quickly turned around and started wework in me and miguel have this common ground mr neumann said we both grew up in very close communities image we only have members says miguel mckelvey the other co founder referring to the people and companies that rent space from wework that ridiculous we need to have two million and then million creditcole wilson for the  wework didn invent co working spaces of course iwg better known as regus has been around for decades but mr neumann and mr mckelvey quickly hit upon recipe that drew throngs of start ups an industrial chic aesthetic some big common areas with comfy couches free beer and piped in pop music individuals pay as little as month for occasional access to desk in common area start ups can pay few thousand dollars for private room on month to month basis and some big companies pay millions of dollars year for spaces that hold thousands of employees over multiple locations it formula that has caught on from new york to tel aviv to shanghai in new york alone wework has spaces most of them nearly full at the wework in harlem dance companies share space with hair care start ups in common area adorned with murals of jazz musicians at wework in tribeca fashion designers and alcohol distributors work shoulder to shoulder in spartan space decorated with neon lighting for wework to really succeed in changing the way we all work it is going to have to win over big corporations seeking space for thousands of employees the strategy is an odd reversal for wework which made its name catering to freelancers and start ups the weather channel recently moved its ad sales team into an enormous wework in midtown manhattan barbara bekkedahl who runs the group said the transition was easy and the space comfortable and stylish but ms bekkedahl had complaint too one that highlights one of the downsides of communal work space she suggested that the hygienic and sartorial habits of some of her new office mates were lacking as tv sales team we groom and dress for outside sales she said some of the techie and start up types  d at wework aren facing customers all day so don always have the same standards gripes about grooming are unlikely to slow down wework business with corporate clients e ly if mr neumann makes good on his promise to save them money because wework is building out so much space and buying so much furniture mr neumann says he can renovate and operate an office for fraction of the cost that companies   normally spend we have economies of scale he said ll cut your operational costs between to percent it might seem like another instance of mr neumann talking big game but for the fact that more and more companies ge hsbc salesforce and microsoft among them are signing on for years now big companies have outsourced payroll processing janitorial services and security it not stretch to imagine more of them outsourcing the design and maintenance of their offices to company like wework we only have members mr mckelvey said that ridiculous we need to have two million and then million more we than me bankers and lawyers poured out of skyscrapers and made for the suburbs on recent monday night in manhattan financial district but at wall street building controlled entirely by wework the party was just getting started last year this era office tower was converted into mixed use development of mr neumann design there is co working space on the ground floor are trendy restaurants including westville fuku momofuku milk bar and bar called the mail room and then there is welive complex of about fully furnished apartments rented out on short term basis tenants get the signature wework aesthetic of unpolished wood and wrought iron as well as various perks there are hot tubs on the terrace there are arcade games and pool table in the laundry room there are chef kitchen and communal dining room at bar on residential floor happy hour was brewing and free tempranillo was flowing in the communal dining area three brothers jordan jake and jimmy decicco were cooking for half dozen social media influencers hoping to stir up enthusiasm for their protein infused iced coffee company over rib eye steaks and brussels sprouts they talked about promoting the brand and breaking into new markets passing out beers to anyone who walked by imagethe rise gym in the wework occupied building at broad street in downtown manhattan creditcole wilson for the  imagethe spa area at broad street creditcole wilson for the  imagethe laundry room at welive at wall street includes pool table and arcade games the wework founders conceived an office environment that quickly drew throngs of start ups an industrial chic aesthetic some big common areas with comfy couches free beer and piped in pop music creditcole wilson for the  the brothers are all in they live in welive work in the adjacent wework space and exercise at wework nearby gym rise it awesome jake decicco said you just roll out of bed go down the elevator and get to work had mr neumann been there to share beer those words   have been music to his ears he believes that creating work and living environment where people mingle is in fact world changing innovation each wework has community manager who keeps tabs on members makes introductions and organizes social activities if more strangers are colliding by the grapefruit water the thinking goes they are more likely to meet up and invest in one another socially responsible start ups and then the world will be better place once you choose to enter wework you choose to be part of something more we than me mr neumann said people start coming together they ll see each other in the elevator they talk in the stairways there thousand other things they do elevators stairways hardly world changing innovations but wework takes extra steps to encourage fraternization like beer kegs that never run dry more than most companies wework promotes the consumption of alcohol as an inherent virtue posters on the wall encourage people to have drink there are wine tastings at welive company parties feature top shelf liquor mr neumann has well known penchant for tequila and well stocked bar is prominent in his office on recent tuesday at the community manager of wework in midtown manhattan sent an email   it time to get your creative juices flowing join us on the th floor to drink some wine paint beautiful picture just after noon on valentine day there was an invitation to share wine and cake in the common area though alcohol is social lubricant for some it can be off putting to many others many women have shared stories of feeling uncomfortable with what they described as frat   culture at some weworks prompting some to leave as wework has grown minor scandals have rattled the company in the company grew ensnared in complicated legal dispute with group of former janitors who tried to unionize at subcontractor that wework used the next year wework drew scrutiny for its use of arbitration to settle workplace disputes and for its firing of an employee who refused to adhere to related policy but so far nothing not alcohol labor disputes questions about the business fundamentals or bad publicity has managed to alter the company trajectory we re disrupter of the way people view the spaces they work in on day to day basis said mr dunlevie of benchmark and we re in the early days of taking advantage of that phenomenon teaching tykesin september wework will open its most ambitious project to date kindergarten it may also be the effort that tests whether wework is flying too close to the sun the creation of mr neumann wife rebekah the school is known as wegrow when it opens it promises well designed space with curriculum that emphasizes socializing and entrepreneurship for year olds on up wegrow fits neatly into mr neumann expansive vision for creating generation of empathetic social impact entrepreneurs but the risk reward calculus is different when starting school wegrow won scale as rapidly as wework has so the financial upside is limited yet should something go wrong the fallout   be devastating it one thing to be responsible for the internet going out or paper running low at the communal printer it another thing to take responsibility for the health and development of someone child imageaspirations for the coming year were recently posted in the hallway of rise gym creditcole wilson for the  though ms neumann has no background in education on the website she describes herself as an avid student of life and says her superpower is intuition she has applied for accreditation from the state has hired team of career educators and is accepting applications for the coming school year tuition for toddlers year we all understand how complicated and regulated school is compared to the simpler business that we are already in mr neumann said but we decided we re going to go into education if you really want to change the world change kids when they re as he proselytized mr neumann was sitting on an enormous leather couch in his chelsea office which is bigger than many new york city apartments it included conference table video conferencing setup several desks bar spreads of food peloton exercise bike climbing machine boxing bag hanging from the ceiling gong an antechamber where assistants work and private bathroom it going to work mr neumann  d is it going to be perfect definitely not are we going to make mistakes hundred percent are we going to be comfortable admitting those mistakes definitely it what we do here though such unbridled zeal can be abrasive to some it   also be viewed as the mark of peripatetic savant walter isaacson the biographer of steve jobs albert einstein benjamin franklin and leonardo da vinci counts mr neumann as friend and said he shared some of the attributes that had allowed those other titans to succeed he has an instinctive feel for how millennials are going to want to have community work experiences without joining large corporations mr isaacson said and like steve jobs and other great entrepreneurs he knows how to connect the humanities with business and technology make life it can be tempting to dismiss wework as just another overvalued start up that is high on its own rhetoric and flush with easy money from na ve investors with little more than faddish interior design free beer and an invitation to socialize with strangers mr neumann claims to have conjured up whole new paradigm for white collar workers and for education and vows that it can change the world it the kind of utopian prattle that can come off as dangerously out of touch at moment when backlash against big tech is brewing but if any of these potential pitfalls concern mr neumann he doesn show it on wednesday night in january mr neumann

performer the grammy winning rapper macklemore waited backstage mr neumann went on an impromptu riff about how people should make life not just living the company aspirational motto mr neumann also stated that it was important to support social entrepreneurs of course that makes lot of sense but who going to pay for that he said and we said well masa might the line generated laugh among the hundreds of knowing employees in the room mr son whose nickname is masa was conveniently absent but it was tell from mr neumann sly admission that at this point he is playing with   money then when the time came to choose winner mr neumann made surprise announcement instead of choosing one recipient wework   give away million each to two of the companies re printing company and global vision nonprofit that provides prescription glasses to people in the developing world and it   give another couple of million to the other half dozen finalists confetti fell from the rafters the winners
