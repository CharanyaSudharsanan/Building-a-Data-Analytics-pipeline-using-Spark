controversy for his company declining sales stepped down after he was criticized for his comments what has not happened in any of these cases is cooling of partisan tensions even in rare cases when pragmatic business leaders helped to broker agreements which was reportedly the case in north carolina with the repeal of the so called bathroom bill culture war still festers activism has typically not brought people together working from the middle out instead this type of activism largely from the progressive side has begun to galvanize conservatives for example in georgia lawmakers stripped

automatic rejection of members of the opposing party are infecting our society there will be rash of news stories about increased sales from liberal consumers rushing into dick stores to vote with their wallets conservative media will point to boycotts and highlight other retailers that are stepping in to serve disaffected consumers but the real   will be the long game activism represents historic shift in the way corporations intersect with national politics rather than chief executives shaping political discourse however our toxic political environment is dictating corporate strategy
