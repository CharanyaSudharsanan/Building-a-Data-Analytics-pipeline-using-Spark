Montana than from Delaware seven And while yes Montana outdoes Delaware in size and population consider that the District of Columbia has   the pedigree with only two thirds the population There are some reasons for this Delaware was one of two states last year in which more high school boys played lacrosse than basketball the other was Maryland There were more athletes playing soccer and football in the state as well Richard Lapchick chairman of the sports business management program at Central Florida and director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport said lack of

us up Mark Sills longtime organizer of youth basketball said of Pennsylvania and Maryland We ve had great players come out of here but we don get the publicity Even the publicity that players do get can have sarcastic undertone Villanova Coach Jay Wright for instance has called DiVincenzo the Michael Jordan of Delaware The nickname has stuck He certainly put Delaware on map DiVincenzo high school

There lot of in state pride when somebody from little old Delaware makes it Folks in Delaware still talk wistfully about Walter Davis an adopted son he was born in North Carolina and played at Sanford

native and transcendent superstar for the University of Delaware who was drafted second over all by the Chicago Sky in Sills said he had detected clear uptick in interest among girls players thanks to her influence The hope Waterman said is that Duval will have similar impact for boys basketball in the state Whether he wants to he carrying the flag right now said Waterman five time state champion

Beretta the school principal and assistant basketball coach said You just never knew He   all of sudden just turn it on But after DiVincenzo junior year rumor began to circulate that he was planning to leave to attend prep school out of state It grew pervasive enough that Villanova coaches called Haley at Salesianum to assure him that they were not the ones encouraging him to leave If you re in Delaware that almost the thing to do Haley said People start talking about where you re going to go Clearly it touched nerve This is problem for Delaware Its best players are too often emigrating out
