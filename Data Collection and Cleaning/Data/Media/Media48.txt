Snapchat began as an app to send disappearing messages to friends but it later added professional content from media companies and other features When the company changed the app last year the goal was to separate chats and stories from friends from the content of media properties such as celebrities and publications In practice that meant Snapchat had two sides The left side of the app featured chats and stories shared with or by people friends On the right side was content from publishers amateur creators and celebrities and stories that Snap curated from user generated videos and  s The goal was to expand the more lucrative media side of the business and to increase the app appeal to an older demographic But over the past few months the changes diluted the core chat experience which became cluttered with user stories Snapchat users who are mostly young quickly rebelled Snap has their back against the wall said Daniel Ives the head of technology research for GBH Insights They need
