rich and poor core message of her campaign for public office CreditSam Hodgson for The  By Ginia BellafanteMarch On frigid Tuesday morning in Brooklyn Cynthia Nixon in her first official campaign venture made the case for herself to become the next governor of New York an impassioned liberal who   lead vigorously from the left Her choice of venue the Bethesda Healing Center church in Brownsville historically the poorest neighborhood in New York City suggested she meant it Reflecting the surrounding demographics the audience was made up almost entirely of African Americans population she argued the current governor Andrew Cuomo has disregarded with too little investment in public schools too little effort made at eradicating inequality too much capitulation to big moneyed interests and venal and corrupt state legislators Ms Nixon laid out her biography the child of single mother with whom she had lived in fifth floor walk up graduate of New York City public schools who sends her own children to them young woman who paid for her college education herself The unspoken assertion was both obvious and deft that while she may be an actress she is in fact the real thing it is her opponent with his back room dealing and corporate coddling and dynastic affiliations who stands as the role player and the phony Many have found Mr Cuomo sincerity as progressive Democrat dubious if not entirely unconvincing but the problem for Ms Nixon is that as performer of related ideologies in recent years he has done quite well Ever since Zephyr Teachout an unknown law professor challenged him for his second term run in to surprising results in the primary he has been forced to tack left signing legislation two years ago to enact an hour minimum wage as well as paid family leave More recently he proposed sweeping package of criminal justice reforms that   among other actions eliminate monetary bail and reduce delays and adjournments in court proceedings that keep people unnecessarily in jail As feminist too his stagecraft has been successful On Monday as Ms Nixon said that she   run Mr Cuomo directed the state attorney general to review the ways in which the Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance Jr had handled or mishandled allegation of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein In her speech on Tuesday Ms Nixon called for greater investment in the city ever deteriorating public housing system Only few days earlier during an appearance at the Jackson  s in the Bronx the governor who served as the federal housing secretary under President Bill Clinton said he was prepared to declare state of emergency in the buildings of the New York City Housing Authority which   allow him to replace its failing management team appointed by the city He also promised to release million of state funds to the agency once an independent monitor had been appointed to oversee all that has gone wrong In the continuing war between the governor and Mayor Bill de Blasio it has been Mr Cuomo who has been continually advancing amounting to another hindrance for Ms Nixon longtime public education activist she has been strong supporter of the mayor but Mr de Blasio who is so intensely disliked by so many of his own Democratic constituents   provide her with little advantage in her own race Within two hours of Ms Nixon speech on Tuesday the former City Council speaker Christine Quinn openly gay and an ally of the governor declared via The New York Post that Ms Nixon was an unqualified lesbian who should not have opposed her own more viable bid to become the mayor of New York several years ago when Mr de Blasio won his first term Ms Quinn lost in part because she was unable to come up with pitch that voters found as resonant as Mr de Blasio tale of two cities rhetoric his focus on the vast gaps between the rich and the disadvantaged Ms Nixon wants to stand in the same philosophical space railing against the unaffordable city the tyranny of urban plutocrats But she earned her celebrity and fortune through pop cultural product Sex and the City that promoted vision of New York that stands entirely in opposition to her professed values It was the HBO series beyond any other entertainment that helped solidify the image of the city as luxury brand an elite fantastical consumer paradise where it was never too early or late in the day
