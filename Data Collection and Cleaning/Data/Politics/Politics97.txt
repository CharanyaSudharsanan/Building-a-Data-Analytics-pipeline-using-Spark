Bolton PAC received was derived from the Facebook data said Christopher Wylie data expert who was part of the team that founded Cambridge Analytica We definitely told them about how we were doing it We talked about it in conference calls in meetings Cambridge Analytica which rose to prominence through its work with Mr Trump election campaign has found itself confronting deepening crisis since reports this past weekend in The   and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters Cambridge so called psychographic modeling techniques which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook underpinned its work for Mr Trump campaign in setting off furious and still unsettled debate about whether the firm technology worked The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr Bolton super PAC The Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was becoming limp wristed and spineless and it wanted research and messaging for national security issues Mr Wylie said That really meant making people more militaristic in their worldview he added That what they said they wanted anyway Using the psychographic models Cambridge helped design concepts for advertisements for candidates supported by Mr Bolton PAC including the campaign of Thom Tillis the Republican senator from North Carolina according to Mr Wylie and another former employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being dragged into the investigations that now appear to be engulfing Cambridge One advertisement video that was posted on YouTube was aimed at people who scored high for conscientiousness and were thought to respect hard work and experience It emphasized Mr Bolton time working for Ronald Reagan and how Mr Tillis embodied the spirit and political ethos of the late president Keep America Secure For Our Children Video by Team John Bolton

the firm board of directors Stephen Bannon was also co founder At the same time Mr Mercer was financially supporting Mr Bolton PAC donating million between April and September according to Federal Election Commission filings The Mercers also backed Mr Trump in the presidential election The Mercer family has not publicly commented since the reports about the misuse of Facebook data by Cambridge first surfaced in The   and The Observer The reports have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica The company also suspended its chief executive Alexander Nix after television broadcast this week in which he was recorded suggesting that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections But it is the harvesting of Facebook data that has cast the harshest spotlight on Cambridge and Mr Bolton experience with the company   to have provided model for how it sold itself to future political campaigns including Mr Trump Advertisement     the main   The firm took the
