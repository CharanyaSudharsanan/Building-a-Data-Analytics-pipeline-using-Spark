sweeping consequences for the so called gig economy the California Supreme Court on Monday made it much more difficult for companies to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees The decision   eventually require companies like Uber many of which are based in California to follow minimum wage and overtime laws and to pay workers compensation and unemployment insurance and payroll taxes potentially upending their business models Industry executives have estimated that classifying drivers and other gig workers as employees tends to cost to percent more than classifying them as contractors It also brings benefits that can offset these costs though like the ability to control schedules and the manner of work It massive thing definitely game changer that will force everyone to take fresh look at the whole issue said Richard Meneghello co chairman of the gig economy practice group at the management side law firm Fisher Phillips Advertisement     the

amount of supervision and whether the worker   be fired without cause     the main   Advertisement     the main   In its place the court erected much simpler ABC test that is applied in Massachusetts and New Jersey Under that test the worker is considered an employee if he or she performs job that is part of the usual course of the company business By way of an example the court said plumber hired by store to fix bathroom leak   not reasonably be considered an employee of that store But seamstresses sewing at home using materials provided by clothing manufacturer   probably be considered

that workers at companies like GrubHub and Uber as now constituted were employees rather than contractors the companies   respond in several ways They   simply make their workers employees rather than contactors Alternatively ride hailing companies like Uber might choose to rein in their operations providing more limited platform in which drivers and passengers can negotiate prices and the terms of
